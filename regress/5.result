 GPT: The 'woke mind virus' is a problem because it can spread

 TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a problem because it is a form
 of groupthink that can lead to people disregarding facts in
 favor of emotionally-driven beliefs that may not be based in
 reality. This can lead to people making decisions based on
 false information and conspiracy theories, which can have
 serious consequences. To combat this, people should strive to
 be open to new ideas and perspectives, verify information
 before accepting it as true, and practice critical thinking.
 Additionally, it is important to be aware of how our own
 biases can affect the way we interpret information.
