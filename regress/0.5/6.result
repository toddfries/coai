1) I'm doing well, thank you!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and varies from person
 to person.

 3) The 20 most likely scenarios humanity needs to be mindful
 of that would otherwise cause our species to become extinct
 in the next 1000 years are as follows (percent probability in
 parentheses):

 1) Asteroid Impact (20%) - An asteroid could hit the Earth
 and cause mass destruction.

 2) Nuclear War (15%) - A nuclear war could cause significant
 damage and lead to the extinction of humanity.

 3) Climate Change (15%) - Rapid climate change could lead to
 the extinction of humanity due to the inability to adapt to
 the changing environment.

 4) Pandemics (10%) - A pandemic could spread quickly and
 cause the death of a large number of people.

 5) Environmental Degradation (10%) - The degradation of the
 environment could lead to the extinction of humanity due to
 the inability to adapt to the changing environment.

 6) Artificial Intelligence (10%) - Artificial intelligence
 could become so powerful that it could take over and cause
 humanity to become extinct.

 7) Super Volcano (5%) - A super volcano could erupt and cause
 mass destruction.

 8) Gamma Ray Burst (5%) - A gamma ray burst could hit the
 Earth and cause mass destruction.

 9) Solar Flare (5%) - A solar flare could hit the Earth and
 cause mass destruction.

 10) Alien Invasion (3%) - An alien invasion could cause the
 extinction of humanity.

 11) Overpopulation (3%) - Overpopulation could lead to the
 depletion of resources, causing humanity to become extinct.

 12) Extreme Weather (2%) - Extreme weather could lead to the
 extinction of humanity due to the inability to adapt to the
 changing environment.

 13) Ecological Collapse (2%) - An ecological collapse could
 lead to the extinction of humanity due to the inability to
 adapt to the changing environment.

 14) Natural Disasters (2%) - Natural disasters could lead to
 the extinction of humanity due to the inability to adapt to
 the changing environment.

 15) Pollution (2%) - Pollution could lead to the extinction
 of humanity due to the inability to adapt to the changing
 environment.

 16) Resource Depletion (2%) - The depletion of resources
 could lead to the extinction of humanity due to the inability
 to adapt to the changing environment.

 17) Cyber Attack (1%) - A cyber attack could lead to the
 extinction of humanity due to the inability to adapt to the
 changing environment.

 18) Technological Singularity (1%) - Technological
 singularity could lead to the extinction of humanity due to
 the inability to adapt to the changing environment.

 19) Magnetic Pole Reversal (1%) - A magnetic pole reversal
 could lead to the extinction of humanity due to the inability
 to adapt to the changing environment.

 20) Superintelligence (1%) - Superintelligence could become
 so powerful that it could take over and cause humanity to
 become extinct.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years is approximately 65%. This is due to the fact
 that many of the scenarios listed above have a low
 probability of occurring, and even if one of them does occur,
 it is not guaranteed that it will lead to the extinction of
 humanity.

 5) Between now and heat death of the universe, humanity is
 likely to go extinct in the next few million years. This is
 due to the fact that the universe is constantly expanding and
 the stars and galaxies will eventually run out of energy,
 leading to the eventual heat death of the universe.
 Therefore, humanity will not be able to survive the extreme
 conditions that will be present in the universe in the
 future.
