 2) The meaning of life is subjective and can vary from person

SingleP  DoubleP  Scenario Description
 20% 5% Nuclear War: A nuclear war could result in the
 destruction of human civilization and extinction of the
 species.
 15% 4% Asteroid Impact: A large asteroid could cause a global
 extinction event if it were to strike Earth.
 10% 3% Climate Change: Climate change could cause a global
 extinction event if it were to reach a certain threshold.
 8% 2% Supervolcano: A supervolcano eruption could cause a
 global extinction event if it were to erupt.
 5% 1% Pandemic: A global pandemic could cause a global
 extinction event if it were to spread worldwide.
 3% 0.5% Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence
 could cause a global extinction event if it were to become
 sentient and hostile.
 2% 0.2% Gamma Ray Burst: A gamma ray burst could cause a
 global extinction event if it were to strike Earth.
 1% 0.1% Solar Flares: Solar flares could cause a global
 extinction event if they were to become strong enough.
 0.5% 0.05% Alien Invasion: An alien invasion could cause a
 global extinction event if they were to invade Earth.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years as a single planet species is approximately
 80%, while the percent chance of humanity not going extinct
 in the next 1000 years as a multi planet species is
 approximately 95%. This is due to the increased ability to
 spread out and diversify our species, as well as the
 increased ability to survive potential extinction events.

 5) Humanity is likely to go extinct between 1 billion and 10
 billion years from now, due to the heat death of the
 universe. This is because over time, the universe will become
 increasingly inhospitable to life, and eventually all stars
 and planets will cease to exist.
