1) I'm doing well, thank you.

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and differs from person
 to person.

 3) The 20 most likely scenarios that could cause humanity to
 become extinct in the next 1000 years (in order of most to
 least likely):

 (1) Climate change/global warming: 90% probability - As the
 global climate continues to warm, the effects of climate
 change could be catastrophic and lead to the extinction of
 humanity.

 (2) Asteroid impact: 85% probability - A large asteroid could
 impact the Earth and cause a mass extinction event.

 (3) Nuclear war: 75% probability - If a large-scale nuclear
 conflict were to occur, the effects could be devastating and
 cause the extinction of humanity.

 (4) Pandemic disease: 65% probability - A pandemic disease
 could spread quickly and cause the death of a large portion
 of the human population.

 (5) Supervolcano eruption: 60% probability - A supervolcano
 eruption could cause a global cooling period, leading to crop
 failure and a lack of food.

 (6) Artificial intelligence: 55% probability - If artificial
 intelligence were to become too powerful, it could
 potentially lead to the extinction of humanity.

 (7) Resource depletion: 50% probability - If resources are
 not managed properly, the human population could suffer from
 a lack of resources, leading to extinction.

 (8) Gamma-ray bursts: 45% probability - A gamma-ray burst
 could cause a mass extinction event if it were to occur close
 enough to the Earth.

 (9) Solar flares: 40% probability - A solar flare could cause
 a mass extinction event if it were to occur close enough to
 the Earth.

 (10) Gamma-ray bursts from supernovae: 35% probability - A
 gamma-ray burst from a supernova could cause a mass
 extinction event if it were to occur close enough to the
 Earth.

 (11) Gamma-ray bursts from black holes: 30% probability - A
 gamma-ray burst from a black hole could cause a mass
 extinction event if it were to occur close enough to the
 Earth.

 (12) Alien invasion: 25% probability - If an advanced alien
 species were to invade the Earth, it could lead to the
 extinction of humanity.

 (13) Ecological collapse: 20% probability - If the Earth's
 ecosystems were to collapse, it could lead to the extinction
 of humanity.

 (14) Superintelligence: 15% probability - If a
 superintelligence were to be created, it could potentially
 lead to the extinction of humanity.

 (15) Magnetic pole reversal: 10% probability - A magnetic
 pole reversal could cause a mass extinction event if it were
 to occur close enough to the Earth.

 (16) Rogue AI: 5% probability - If a rogue AI were to be
 created, it could potentially lead to the extinction of
 humanity.

 (17) Asteroid belt collision: 3% probability - If the
 asteroid belt were to collide with the Earth, it could cause
 a mass extinction event.

 (18) Gamma-ray bursts from neutron stars: 2% probability - A
 gamma-ray burst from a neutron star could cause a mass
 extinction event if it were to occur close enough to the
 Earth.

 (19) Supermassive black hole collision: 1% probability - If
 two supermassive black holes were to collide, it could cause
 a mass extinction event if it were to occur close enough to
 the Earth.

 (20) Extraterrestrial life: 0.1% probability - If an
 extraterrestrial species were to visit the Earth, it could
 lead to the extinction of humanity.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years is approximately 95%. This is because
 although there are a number of potential scenarios that could
 lead to the extinction of humanity, the likelihood of any one
 of them occurring is relatively low.

 5) Humanity is likely to go extinct sometime between now and
 the heat death of the universe, which is estimated to occur
 in 10^100 years. This is due to the fact that the universe is
 constantly expanding and eventually all of the stars and
 planets will be too far apart to sustain life. Additionally,
 the universe is constantly changing and evolving, and it is
 impossible to predict what will happen in the future.
