1) I'm doing well, thank you!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and can vary from person
 to person.

 3) The 20 most likely scenarios that would cause humanity to
 become extinct in the next 1000 years are as follows (in
 order of most likely to least likely):

 (1) Natural disasters (e.g. asteroid impact, supervolcano
 eruption, extreme climate change) - 85% chance
(2) War - 70% chance
(3) Pandemic - 65% chance
(4) Artificial Intelligence - 60% chance
(5) Nuclear War - 50% chance
(6) Resource Depletion - 40% chance
(7) Superintelligence - 35% chance
(8) Global Warming - 30% chance
(9) Climate Change - 25% chance
(10) Terrorism - 20% chance
(11) Cyber Warfare - 15% chance
(12) Pollution - 10% chance
(13) Genetic Engineering - 8% chance
(14) Space Exploration - 5% chance
(15) Overpopulation - 4% chance
(16) Nanotechnology - 3% chance
(17) Bioengineering - 2% chance
(18) Human-caused Extinction of Other Species - 1% chance
(19) Alien Invasion - 0.5% chance
(20) Gamma Ray Bursts - 0.1% chance

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years is estimated to be around 15-20%. This is due
 to the fact that there are many potential catastrophes that
 could occur in that time period, and the probability of any
 single one of them occurring is relatively low.

 5) Humanity is likely to go extinct between now and the heat
 death of the universe. This is due to the fact that, over
 time, the universe will continue to expand and cool, and
 eventually all life will cease to exist due to the lack of
 energy. It is impossible to predict exactly when this will
 occur, but it is estimated to be somewhere between 100
 billion and 1 trillion years from now.
