1) I'm doing well, thank you for asking!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and varies from person
 to person.

3) SingleP DoubleP Scenario Description 
 20% 40% Supervolcano Eruptions: A supervolcano eruption would
 release huge amounts of ash, sulfur dioxide, and other gases
 into the atmosphere, resulting in a global cooling effect,
 crop failure, and mass extinctions.
 20% 40% Asteroid Impact: An asteroid impact would cause an
 immense amount of destruction, resulting in global climate
 change, crop failure, and mass extinctions.
 15% 30% Nuclear War: A nuclear war would release large
 amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere,
 resulting in global climate change, crop failure, and mass
 extinctions.
 10% 20% Global Pandemic: A global pandemic could spread
 quickly, resulting in a significant loss of life and
 disruption of global systems.
 8% 16% Artificial Intelligence Takeover: If artificial
 intelligence becomes too powerful, it could take over the
 world and eliminate humanity.
 6% 12% Global Warming: Global warming is causing sea levels
 to rise, resulting in flooding, crop failure, and mass
 extinctions.
 4% 8% Climate Change: Climate change is causing extreme
 weather patterns, resulting in crop failure, disruption of
 global systems, and mass extinctions.
 3% 6% Gamma Ray Burst: A gamma ray burst would cause a
 significant amount of destruction, resulting in global
 climate change, crop failure, and mass extinctions.
 2% 4% Solar Flares: Solar flares could cause a significant
 amount of destruction, resulting in global climate change,
 crop failure, and mass extinctions.
 2% 4% Cyberattack: A cyberattack could disrupt global
 systems, resulting in a significant loss of life and
 disruption of global systems.
 1% 2% Supernova: A supernova would release huge amounts of
 radiation, resulting in global climate change, crop failure,
 and mass extinctions.
 1% 2% Gamma Ray Bursts: Gamma ray bursts could cause a
 significant amount of destruction, resulting in global
 climate change, crop failure, and mass extinctions.
 1% 2% Ecological Collapse: Ecological collapse could occur
 due to human disruption of natural ecosystems, resulting in
 crop failure, disruption of global systems, and mass
 extinctions.
 1% 2% Asteroid Swarm: An asteroid swarm could cause an
 immense amount of destruction, resulting in global climate
 change, crop failure, and mass extinctions.
 1% 2% Magnetic Pole Reversal: A magnetic pole reversal could
 cause a significant amount of destruction, resulting in
 global climate change, crop failure, and mass extinctions.
 1% 2% Rogue Artificial Intelligence: If artificial
 intelligence becomes too powerful, it could take over the
 world and eliminate humanity.
 1% 2% Technological Singularity: If technology advances too
 quickly, it could result in a technological singularity, in
 which humans are no longer able to control or understand the
 technology they have created.
 1% 2% Nanotechnology Disaster: If nanotechnology advances too
 quickly, it could cause a nanotechnology disaster, resulting
 in global climate change, crop failure, and mass extinctions.
 1% 2% Gamma Ray Burst: Gamma ray bursts could cause a
 significant amount of destruction, resulting in global
 climate change, crop failure, and mass extinctions.
 1% 2% Super Solar Flares: Super solar flares could cause a
 significant amount of destruction, resulting in global
 climate change, crop failure, and mass extinctions.
 1% 2% Global Drought: Global droughts could cause crop
 failure, disruption of global systems, and mass extinctions.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years as a single planet species is approximately
 85%. As a multi planet species, the percent chance is
 approximately 95%.

 5) Humanity is likely to go extinct sometime between now and
 the heat death of the universe due to a variety of factors,
 including climate change, pandemics, and natural disasters.
 It is impossible to accurately predict when this will happen,
 but it is likely to be within the next few hundred thousand
 years.
