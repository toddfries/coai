1) I'm doing well, thank you.

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and can be different for
 everyone.

SingleP  DoubleP  Scenario Description
 10% 20% Solar Flares: Solar flares could disrupt technology
 and cause an extinction event.
 15% 30% Asteroid Impact: An asteroid could hit Earth and
 cause a mass extinction.
 20% 40% Supervolcano Eruption: A supervolcano eruption could
 cause a global cooling event, leading to an extinction event.
 25% 50% Gamma Ray Burst: A gamma ray burst from a distant
 star could cause a mass extinction.
 30% 60% Climate Change: Climate change caused by human
 activities could lead to an extinction event.
 35% 70% Nuclear War: A nuclear war could cause a global
 extinction event.
 40% 80% Pandemic: A global pandemic could lead to a mass
 extinction event.
 45% 90% Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence
 could cause a global extinction event.
 50% 100% Alien Invasion: An alien invasion could cause a
 global extinction event.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years as a single planet species is estimated to be
 around 90%. As a multi-planet species, the percent chance of
 not going extinct is estimated to be around 99%. The main
 risks to humanity as a single planet species are climate
 change, pandemics, and nuclear war. As a multi-planet
 species, the main risks are still climate change, pandemics,
 and nuclear war, but also include risks such as artificial
 intelligence, alien invasions, and gamma ray bursts.

 5) Humanity is likely to go extinct between now and the heat
 death of the universe due to a variety of potential risks,
 such as climate change, pandemics, nuclear war, and
 artificial intelligence. It is impossible to predict when
 exactly this will happen, but it is likely to occur within
 the next few thousand years.
