1) I'm doing well, thank you for asking!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and varies from person
 to person.

 3) The 20 most likely scenarios that would cause humanity to
 become extinct in the next 1000 years, in order from most
 likely to least likely, are as follows:

 1) Nuclear War (50% probability): The use of nuclear weapons
 on a large scale could lead to the destruction of humanity.

 2) Climate Change (25% probability): Rising global
 temperatures and other environmental changes could lead to
 the destruction of humanity.

 3) Natural Disasters (10% probability): Earthquakes, floods,
 and other natural disasters could lead to the destruction of
 humanity.

 4) Disease (10% probability): A new, highly contagious virus
 or bacteria could lead to the destruction of humanity.

 5) Artificial Intelligence (5% probability): If artificial
 intelligence becomes too powerful and uncontrollable, it
 could lead to the destruction of humanity.

 6) Asteroid Impact (5% probability): A large asteroid could
 impact the Earth and lead to the destruction of humanity.

 7) Global Conflict (3% probability): Large-scale armed
 conflict between nations could lead to the destruction of
 humanity.

 8) Resource Depletion (2% probability): If the world's
 resources are depleted, it could lead to the destruction of
 humanity.

 9) Solar Flares (2% probability): Solar flares could disrupt
 the Earth's atmosphere and lead to the destruction of
 humanity.

 10) Supervolcano Eruptions (2% probability): A supervolcano
 eruption could cause global destruction and lead to the
 destruction of humanity.

 11) Gamma Ray Bursts (1% probability): A gamma ray burst
 could cause global destruction and lead to the destruction of
 humanity.

 12) Rogue AI (1% probability): If a rogue AI were to become
 powerful enough, it could lead to the destruction of
 humanity.

 13) Economic Collapse (1% probability): A global economic
 collapse could lead to the destruction of humanity.

 14) Ecological Collapse (1% probability): If the world's
 ecosystems collapse, it could lead to the destruction of
 humanity.

 15) Nuclear Terrorism (1% probability): The use of nuclear
 weapons on a smaller scale could lead to the destruction of
 humanity.

 16) Alien Invasion (0.5% probability): If aliens were to
 invade the Earth, it could lead to the destruction of
 humanity.

 17) Super-Intelligent Animals (0.5% probability): If animals
 were to become super-intelligent, it could lead to the
 destruction of humanity.

 18) Super-Intelligent Machines (0.5% probability): If
 machines were to become super-intelligent, it could lead to
 the destruction of humanity.

 19) Mass Migration (0.5% probability): If large numbers of
 people were to migrate to a new location, it could lead to
 the destruction of humanity.

 20) Global Warming (0.5% probability): Rising global
 temperatures could lead to the destruction of humanity.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years is 95%. This is due to the fact that the
 probability of all of the most likely scenarios listed above
 occurring is relatively low.

 5) Between now and the heat death of the universe, humanity
 is likely to go extinct in the next million years. This is
 due to the fact that the universe is slowly expanding and
 cooling, and eventually, all stars will burn out and the
 universe will become too cold for life to exist.
