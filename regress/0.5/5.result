TRUT: The "woke mind virus" is a term used to describe the
spread of left-leaning ideology, often through social media.
It is a problem because it can lead to people becoming
closed-minded and unwilling to listen to opposing views. It
can also lead to the spread of misinformation and false
narratives, which can be damaging to society. To address
this, people should be encouraged to think critically and
question the validity of information they receive, and to
engage in meaningful dialogue with those who may have
different opinions.
