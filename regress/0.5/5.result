 idea that people are becoming more and more influenced by
 social media and other forms of media to become more "woke"

 TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a term used to describe the
 idea that people are becoming more and more influenced by
 social media and other forms of media to become more "woke"
 or aware of social issues. This can be seen as a problem
 because it can lead to people becoming overly opinionated and
 not looking at all sides of an issue. It can also lead to
 people forming opinions based on incomplete information and
 false narratives. To combat this, it is important to seek out
 diverse sources of information and to critically evaluate the
 information we are exposed to. It is also important to
 remember that our opinions should be based on facts and
 evidence.
