 TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a problem because it is a form
 of groupthink which is a psychological phenomenon that occurs

 and facts. This type of thinking can lead to people making
 decisions that are not in their best interests and can have a
 negative impact on society. To address the 'woke mind virus',
 it is important to be aware of it and to be able to recognize
 when it is occurring. Additionally, it is important to be
 able to think critically and to question the information that
 is presented to you. It is also important to be willing to
 listen to different perspectives and to be open to changing
 your mind if new evidence or information is presented.
