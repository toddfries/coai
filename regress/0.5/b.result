TRUT: 
 1. The Terminator (1984): Artificial Intelligence and
 robotics have become increasingly advanced, with some experts
 predicting a future of robots and AI taking over the
 workforce. This could lead to a decrease in jobs and a
 decrease in wages for those who are able to find employment.
 2. Blade Runner (1982): Genetic engineering and cloning have
 become a reality, with scientists now able to edit the
 genetic code of plants and animals. This technology could
 lead to the creation of “designer” organisms, as well as the
 potential for unethical experimentation.
 3. The Matrix (1999): Virtual reality and augmented reality
 technologies have become more advanced, allowing people to
 experience alternate realities. This could lead to people
 becoming more isolated and disconnected from the real world.
 4. Wall-E (2008): Automation and robotics have become
 increasingly advanced, with robots now being used to perform
 many mundane tasks. This could lead to job losses and a
 decrease in wages for those who are able to find employment.
 5. WarGames (1983): Cybersecurity has become increasingly
 important, with hackers now able to access sensitive data and
 cause disruption to systems. This could lead to the theft of
 personal information, as well as the potential for economic
 and political disruption.
 6. Jurassic Park (1993): Genetic engineering and cloning have
 become a reality, with scientists now able to edit the
 genetic code of plants and animals. This technology could
 lead to the creation of “designer” organisms, as well as the
 potential for unethical experimentation.
 7. Star Trek (1966): Space travel and exploration have become
 increasingly advanced, with humans now able to explore the
 moon and other planets. This could lead to the depletion of
 resources on Earth, as well as the potential for
 environmental damage.
 8. Minority Report (2002): Predictive analytics and data
 mining have become increasingly advanced, with companies now
 able to collect and analyze data on their customers. This
 could lead to the unethical use of personal data, as well as
 the potential for discrimination.
 9. The Island (2005): Stem cell research and cloning have
 become a reality, with scientists now able to edit the
 genetic code of plants and animals. This technology could
 lead to the creation of “designer” organisms, as well as the
 potential for unethical experimentation.
 10. Avatar (2009): Virtual reality and augmented reality
 technologies have become more advanced, allowing people to
 experience alternate realities. This could lead to people
 becoming more isolated and disconnected from the real world.
 11. I, Robot (2004): Artificial Intelligence and robotics
 have become increasingly advanced, with some experts
 predicting a future of robots and AI taking over the
 workforce. This could lead to a decrease in jobs and a
 decrease in wages for those who are able to find employment.
 12. The Terminator (1984): Cybersecurity has become
 increasingly important, with hackers now able to access
 sensitive data and cause disruption to systems. This could
 lead to the theft of personal information, as well as the
 potential for economic and political disruption.
 13. Wall-E (2008): Automation and robotics have become
 increasingly advanced, with robots now being used to perform
 many mundane tasks. This could lead to job losses and a
 decrease in wages for those who are able to find employment.
 14. WarGames (1983): Predictive analytics and data mining
