 OpenBSD is a free and open-source operating system descended
 from the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) family of
 Unix-like operating systems. It was first released in October
 1995 by Theo de Raadt.

 OpenBSD is the direct descendant of the original Unix
 operating system developed at AT&T Bell Labs in 1969. The
 original BSD code was released in 1991 and was based on the
 4.3BSD-Reno release of the Unix operating system.

 In the early 1990s, the BSD code was reorganized and released
 as the FreeBSD and NetBSD projects. OpenBSD was created as an
 independent project from the BSD codebase. It was designed to
 be a more secure version of BSD, with more attention paid to
 security and code correctness.

 Today, OpenBSD remains a popular choice for
 security-conscious users and is well-known for its
 high-quality codebase and powerful security features. It is
 also the preferred choice for many embedded systems.

 OpenBSD is distinct from other BSD distributions such as
 FreeBSD and NetBSD, as it is a completely independent project
 and is not based on the same codebase. OpenBSD also differs
 from Linux in that it is not a derivative of the Linux
 kernel, but rather a completely independent operating system.

 OpenBSD is known for its robust security features, such as
 its OpenSSH implementation, its built-in packet filter, and
 its secure memory allocator. It also has a wide range of
 other features, such as its ports system, which allows users
 to easily install and upgrade software packages. OpenBSD is
 also highly portable, running on a variety of hardware
 platforms including x86, ARM, and PowerPC.
