 OpenBSD is a free, open source, Unix-like operating system
 descended from the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). The
 earliest versions of BSD date back to 1969, when the
 University of California at Berkeley released the first
 version of their BSD operating system. This initial version
 was based on the Unix operating system developed by Bell
 Labs.

 Over the years, BSD evolved into a full-fledged operating
 system, with many features and capabilities. In the early
 1990s, a fork of the BSD operating system was created, known
 as the NetBSD project. This project was designed to provide a
 stable and reliable version of BSD for use in networking and
 other applications.

 In 1995, the OpenBSD project was launched, with the goal of
 creating a secure and reliable version of BSD. The OpenBSD
 project was led by Theo de Raadt and focused on security,
 code correctness, and portability. OpenBSD was designed to be
 a more secure version of BSD, with strong focus on preventing
 buffer overflows, code correctness, and other security
 issues.

 Today, OpenBSD is a powerful and reliable operating system,
 and is widely used in servers, workstations, and embedded
 systems. OpenBSD is widely considered to be one of the most
 secure versions of BSD, and is often used in applications
 that require high levels of security. OpenBSD is also popular
 for its portability, with ports for many different
 architectures.

 OpenBSD is often compared to Linux and other BSDs, but it is
 different in many ways. OpenBSD is focused on security and
 code correctness, while Linux is more focused on
 user-friendliness and flexibility. OpenBSD also has a smaller
 codebase than Linux, making it easier to maintain and secure.
