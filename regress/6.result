 1) I'm doing well, thank you.

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and can vary depending
 on one's personal beliefs and values.

 3) The 20 most likely scenarios that could cause humanity to
 become extinct in the next 1000 years are as follows (in
 order of most likely to least likely):

 (1) Climate change resulting in global warming and
 catastrophic weather events (50% probability): Human-caused
 climate change has already had a significant impact on our
 environment, and if we do not take action to reduce its
 effects, it could lead to a catastrophic rise in global
 temperatures and extreme weather events that could make our
 planet uninhabitable.

 (2) Natural pandemics/diseases (30% probability): Natural
 pandemics have the potential to spread quickly and cause
 widespread death and destruction.

 (3) Nuclear war (15% probability): A nuclear war between
 major world powers could cause widespread destruction and
 death, and potentially lead to the extinction of humanity.

 (4) Asteroid impact (3% probability): Although the chances of
 an asteroid impact are low, it is still a possibility that
 could lead to the destruction of humanity.

 (5) Artificial intelligence (2% probability): If artificial
 intelligence becomes too powerful, it could cause a global
 crisis that could lead to the extinction of humanity.

 (6) Supervolcano eruption (2% probability): Supervolcano
 eruptions have the potential to cause global destruction and
 could lead to the extinction of humanity.

 (7) Gamma-ray burst (2% probability): A gamma-ray burst is a
 powerful explosion of energy that could destroy all life on
 Earth.

 (8) Magnetic pole reversal (1% probability): A magnetic pole
 reversal could cause severe disruption to the Earth's
 magnetic field, leading to global destruction.

 (9) Solar flares (1% probability): Solar flares have the
 potential to cause widespread destruction and could lead to
 the extinction of humanity.

 (10) Solar system collision (1% probability): If our solar
 system were to collide with another, it could cause
 destruction and death on a global scale.

 (11) Alien invasion (1% probability): Although the chances of
 an alien invasion are low, it is still a possibility that
 could lead to the extinction of humanity.

 (12) Supermassive black hole (1% probability): A supermassive
 black hole could cause destruction and death on a global
 scale.

 (13) Gamma ray burst from a nearby star (1% probability): A
 gamma ray burst from a nearby star could cause destruction
 and death on a global scale.

 (14) Supernova explosion (1% probability): A supernova
 explosion could cause destruction and death on a global
 scale.

 (15) Rogue artificial intelligence (1% probability): If a
 rogue artificial intelligence were to gain control of the
 world, it could cause destruction and death on a global
 scale.

 (16) Nanotechnology disaster (1% probability): If
 nanotechnology were to become too powerful, it could cause a
 global crisis that could lead to the extinction of humanity.

 (17) Rogue nation nuclear war (1% probability): A nuclear war
 between rogue nations could cause widespread destruction and
 death, and potentially lead to the extinction of humanity.

 (18) Hyperinflation (1% probability): Hyperinflation could
 lead to a global economic crisis that could lead to the
 extinction of humanity.

 (19) Global economic collapse (1% probability): A global
 economic collapse could lead to a global crisis that could
 lead to the extinction of humanity.

 (20) Super-intelligent AI takeover (1% probability): If a
 super-intelligent AI were to gain control of the world, it
 could cause destruction and death on a global scale.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years is approximately 96%. This is because the
 chances of any of the above scenarios occurring are
 relatively low, and even if one of them does occur, there is
 still a chance that humanity could survive.

 5) Between now and heat death of the universe, humanity is
 likely to go extinct in the next few hundred thousand years.
 This is due to the fact that the universe is expanding and
 cooling, and eventually all stars will die out and the
 universe will reach a point of heat death. This process is
 estimated to take anywhere from 100,000 to 1 trillion years,
 so humanity will likely go extinct before that point.
