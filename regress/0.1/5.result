 TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a problem because it is a form

 interests or the best interests of society. To combat the
 'woke mind virus', it is important to encourage critical
 thinking and to challenge people to think for themselves.
 People should be encouraged to look at all sides of an issue
 and to consider all the facts before making a decision.
