 TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a problem because it is a form
 of ideological extremism that can lead to dangerous and
 destructive behavior. It is a belief system that is based on
 the idea that certain groups of people are inherently
 superior to others and should be given special privileges and
 rights. This can lead to discrimination, prejudice, and
 violence against those who do not share the same beliefs. To
 combat this, it is important to promote education and
 understanding of different cultures and beliefs, as well as
 to promote acceptance and tolerance of diversity.
 Additionally, it is important to challenge and confront any
 forms of discrimination or prejudice that may arise.
