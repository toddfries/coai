 TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a problem because it is a form
 of groupthink that can lead to people making decisions
 without considering all the facts. It can also lead to people
 making decisions based on emotion rather than logic. This can
 lead to decisions that are not in the best interest of the
 group or society as a whole. To combat the 'woke mind virus',
 it is important to encourage critical thinking and to ensure
 that all voices are heard and respected. Additionally, it is
 important to ensure that facts are verified and that
 decisions are based on evidence and not emotion.
