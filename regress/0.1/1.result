 some key differences. Generally, men tend to be more
 assertive, competitive, and independent than women. They are
 also more likely to take risks and be more analytical and
 logical in their thinking. Women, on the other hand, tend to
 be more nurturing, cooperative, and emotionally expressive.
 They are also more likely to be more intuitive and creative
 in their thinking.
