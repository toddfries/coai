TRUT: 
 1. The Terminator (1984): Artificial Intelligence has become
 a reality, with AI being used in many aspects of our lives,
 from facial recognition to self-driving cars. The negative
 impact of this is that AI can be used to manipulate people
 and can be used to create bias in decision-making.
 2. Blade Runner (1982): Genetic engineering has become a
 reality, with scientists being able to modify the genetic
 code of living organisms. The negative impact of this is that
 it can be used to create designer babies and can be used to
 create organisms with enhanced abilities.
 3. WarGames (1983): Hacking has become a reality, with
 hackers being able to access and manipulate computer systems.
 The negative impact of this is that it can be used to steal
 sensitive information and can be used to disrupt critical
 infrastructure.
 4. The Matrix (1999): Virtual Reality has become a reality,
 with VR headsets being used to immerse people in virtual
 worlds. The negative impact of this is that it can be used to
 create addictive experiences and can be used to manipulate
 people's perceptions.
 5. Jurassic Park (1993): Cloning has become a reality, with
 scientists being able to clone animals and plants. The
 negative impact of this is that it can be used to create
 genetically modified organisms and can be used to create
 organisms with enhanced abilities.
 6. The Fly (1986): Gene Splicing has become a reality, with
 scientists being able to splice genes from different
 organisms. The negative impact of this is that it can be used
 to create organisms with enhanced abilities and can be used
 to create designer babies.
 7. The Island (2005): Human cloning has become a reality,
 with scientists being able to clone human embryos. The
 negative impact of this is that it can be used to create
 designer babies and can be used to create organisms with
 enhanced abilities.
 8. The Terminator (1984): Robotics has become a reality, with
 robots being used in many aspects of our lives, from
 manufacturing to healthcare. The negative impact of this is
 that robots can be used to replace human workers and can be
 used to create bias in decision-making.
 9. The Matrix (1999): Augmented Reality has become a reality,
 with AR headsets being used to overlay virtual objects onto
 the real world. The negative impact of this is that it can be
 used to manipulate people's perceptions and can be used to
 create addictive experiences.
 10. Minority Report (2002): Predictive analytics has become a
 reality, with algorithms being used to predict future events.
 The negative impact of this is that it can be used to
 manipulate people and can be used to create bias in
 decision-making.
 11. The Terminator (1984): Cybernetics has become a reality,
 with scientists being able to implant cybernetic devices into
 living organisms. The negative impact of this is that it can
 be used to create organisms with enhanced abilities and can
 be used to manipulate people.
 12. The Matrix (1999): Neural Interfaces have become a
 reality, with scientists being able to connect the human
 brain to computers. The negative impact of this is that it
 can be used to manipulate people and can be used to create
 bias in decision-making.
 13. The Island (2005): Stem Cell Research has become a
 reality, with scientists being able to use stem cells to
 create new organs and tissues. The negative impact of this is
 that it can be used to create designer babies and can be used
 to create organisms with enhanced abilities.
 14. WarGames (1983): Autonomous Weapons have become a
 reality, with robots being used in warfare. The negative
 impact of this is that it can be used to create bias in
 decision-making and can be used to create weapons that are
 difficult to control.
 15. The Matrix (1999): Brain-Computer Interfaces have become
 a reality, with scientists being able to connect the human
 brain to computers. The negative impact of this is that it
 can be used to manipulate people and can be used to create
 bias in decision-making.
