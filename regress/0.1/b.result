TRUT: 
 1. The Terminator (1984): Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
 become a reality and is being used in many aspects of our
 lives, from self-driving cars to facial recognition software.
 The negative impact of AI is that it can be used to automate
 jobs, leading to job losses and economic instability.
 2. Blade Runner (1982): Genetic engineering has become a
 reality, with scientists now able to modify the genetic code
 of living organisms. The negative impact of this technology
 is that it can be used to create “designer babies”, leading
 to a potential widening of the gap between the rich and the
 poor.
 3. WarGames (1983): Hacking has become a reality, with
 hackers now able to access and manipulate computer systems.
 The negative impact of hacking is that it can be used to
 steal sensitive information, leading to identity theft and
 financial losses.
 4. The Matrix (1999): Virtual reality has become a reality,
 with headsets now able to simulate a 3D environment. The
 negative impact of virtual reality is that it can be used to
 create immersive experiences that can be addictive, leading
 to a disconnect from reality.
 5. Jurassic Park (1993): Cloning has become a reality, with
 scientists now able to clone animals and even human embryos.
 The negative impact of cloning is that it can be used to
 create genetically modified organisms, leading to potential
 health risks.
 6. The Fly (1986): Genetic modification has become a reality,
 with scientists now able to modify the genetic code of living
 organisms. The negative impact of this technology is that it
 can be used to create “designer babies”, leading to a
 potential widening of the gap between the rich and the poor.
 7. The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951): Nuclear weapons have
 become a reality, with countries now possessing the
 capability to launch nuclear weapons. The negative impact of
 nuclear weapons is that they can be used to cause mass
 destruction, leading to the loss of life and property.
 8. The Terminator (1984): Robotics has become a reality, with
 robots now able to perform tasks that were once done by
 humans. The negative impact of robotics is that it can be
 used to automate jobs, leading to job losses and economic
 instability.
 9. The Matrix (1999): Augmented reality has become a reality,
 with headsets now able to overlay digital images onto the
 real world. The negative impact of augmented reality is that
 it can be used to create immersive experiences that can be
 addictive, leading to a disconnect from reality.
 10. The Terminator (1984): Cyber warfare has become a
 reality, with countries now able to launch cyber attacks
 against each other. The negative impact of cyber warfare is
 that it can be used to steal sensitive information, leading
 to identity theft and financial losses.
 11. The Matrix (1999): Artificial intelligence (AI) has
 become a reality and is being used in many aspects of our
 lives, from self-driving cars to facial recognition software.
 The negative impact of AI is that it can be used to automate
 jobs, leading to job losses and economic instability.
 12. WarGames (1983): Autonomous weapons have become a
 reality, with countries now able to deploy weapons that can
 make decisions without human intervention. The negative
 impact of autonomous weapons is that they can be used to
 cause mass destruction, leading to the loss of life and
 property.
 13. The Terminator (1984): Cybernetics has become a reality,
 with scientists now able to implant electronic devices into
 the human body. The negative impact of cybernetics is that it
 can be used to create “enhanced” humans, leading to a
 potential widening of the gap between the enhanced and the
 unenhanced.
 14. The Matrix (1999): Brain-computer interfaces have become
 a reality, with scientists now able to connect the human
 brain to a computer. The negative impact of brain-computer
 interfaces is that they can be used to create “enhanced”
 humans, leading to a potential widening of the gap between
 the enhanced and the unenhanced.
 15. WarGames (1983): Autonomous drones have become a reality,
 with countries now able to deploy drones that can make
 decisions without human intervention. The negative impact of
 autonomous drones is that they can be used to cause mass
 destruction, leading to the loss of life and property.
