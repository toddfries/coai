 a reality, with AI being used in many aspects of our lives,
 from facial recognition to self-driving cars. The negative
 impact of this is that AI can be used to manipulate people
 and can be used to create biased systems.
 2. Blade Runner (1982): Genetic engineering has become a
 reality, with scientists being able to modify the genetic
 code of organisms. The negative impact of this is that it can
 be used to create genetically modified organisms that can
 have unintended consequences.
 3. WarGames (1983): Cyber warfare has become a reality, with
 countries using cyber attacks to gain an advantage over their
 opponents. The negative impact of this is that it can be used
 to disrupt critical infrastructure and can lead to massive
 data breaches.

 negative impact of this is that it can be used to create
 genetically modified organisms that can have unintended
 consequences.
 6. The Fly (1986): Nanotechnology has become a reality, with
 scientists being able to manipulate matter on a molecular
 level. The negative impact of this is that it can be used to
 create weapons that can be used to cause mass destruction.
 7. Total Recall (1990): Memory implants have become a

 reality, with countries using drones and other autonomous
 weapons to gain an advantage over their opponents. The
 negative impact of this is that it can be used to cause mass
 destruction and can lead to civilian casualties.
 12. The Matrix (1999): Brain-computer interfaces have become
 a reality, with scientists being able to connect the brain to
 computers. The negative impact of this is that it can be used
 to manipulate people and can lead to false memories being
 implanted.
 13. WarGames (1983): Cyber espionage has become a reality,
 with countries using cyber attacks to gain an advantage over
 their opponents. The negative impact of this is that it can
 be used to disrupt critical infrastructure and can lead to
 massive data breaches.
 14. Blade Runner (1982): Synthetic biology has become a
 reality, with scientists being able to create synthetic
 organisms. The negative impact of this is that it can be used
 to create genetically modified organisms that can have
 unintended consequences.
 15. The Matrix (1999): Artificial intelligence has become a
 reality, with AI being used in many aspects of our lives,
