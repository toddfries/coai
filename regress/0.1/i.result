 OpenBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system
 descended from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). It was
 first developed in the late 1980s by the University of
 California, Berkeley, and released in 1995.

 The history of OpenBSD dates back to 1969, when the first
 version of the Unix operating system was released. This
 version of Unix was developed at AT&T Bell Labs and was the
 first version of the Unix operating system to be widely used.

 In the late 1970s, the University of California, Berkeley,
 began developing their own version of Unix, called BSD. This
 version of Unix was based on the original AT&T Bell Labs
 version, but included additional features and improvements.
 BSD was released in 1980 and quickly became popular among
 universities and research institutions.

 In the late 1980s, a group of developers at the University of
 California, Berkeley, began working on a new version of BSD,
 called Net/2. This version of BSD was released in 1991 and
 included support for networking and TCP/IP.

 In 1995, the developers of Net/2 released a new version of
 BSD, called OpenBSD. This version of BSD was designed to be
 more secure than other versions of Unix, and included a
 number of security features, such as the OpenBSD Packet
 Filter (PF).

 Today, OpenBSD is one of the most popular versions of BSD,
 and is used by many organizations and individuals around the
 world. It is also one of the most secure versions of Unix,
 and is often used in mission-critical applications.

 OpenBSD is different from Linux in that it is a version of
 BSD, which is a different type of Unix-like operating system.
 OpenBSD is also different from other versions of BSD, such as
 FreeBSD and NetBSD, in that it is more focused on security
 and stability.
