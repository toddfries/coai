 OpenBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system
 descended from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). It was
 initially developed in 1995 by Theo de Raadt and a team of
 developers.

 The history of OpenBSD dates back to 1969 when the first
 version of the Unix operating system was released. This
 version of Unix was developed by AT&T Bell Labs and was the
 first version of the Unix operating system to be released to
 the public.

 In the late 1970s, the University of California, Berkeley
 released its own version of Unix, called Berkeley Software
 Distribution (BSD). This version of Unix was based on the
 original AT&T Bell Labs version, but included additional
 features and improvements.

 In the early 1990s, the BSD operating system was further
 developed by a group of developers led by Theo de Raadt. This
 group of developers created a new version of BSD, called
 NetBSD, which was released in 1993.

 In 1995, Theo de Raadt and his team of developers released
 OpenBSD, which was based on the NetBSD codebase. OpenBSD was
 designed to be a secure and reliable operating system, and it
 included a number of security features that were not present
 in other versions of BSD.

 Today, OpenBSD is one of the most popular versions of BSD,
 and it is used by many organizations and individuals around
 the world. It is also one of the most secure operating
 systems available, and it is often used as a platform for
 developing secure applications.

 OpenBSD is different from Linux and other BSDs in that it is
 focused on security and reliability. It is also designed to
 be easy to use and maintain, and it includes a number of
 tools and features that make it easier to manage.
 Additionally, OpenBSD is designed to be highly portable, and
 it can be used on a variety of hardware platforms.
