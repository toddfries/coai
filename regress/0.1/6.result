1) I'm doing well, thank you!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and varies from person
 to person.

 3) The 20 most likely scenarios that could cause humanity to
 become extinct in the next 1000 years, in order of most
 likely to least likely, are as follows:

 1. Nuclear War (50% probability): A nuclear war between two
 or more countries could cause catastrophic destruction and
 lead to the extinction of humanity.

 2. Climate Change (30% probability): Rising temperatures,
 extreme weather events, and other environmental changes
 caused by human activity could lead to the extinction of
 humanity.

 3. Pandemic (20% probability): A global pandemic could spread
 quickly and cause widespread death and destruction, leading
 to the extinction of humanity.

 4. Asteroid Impact (15% probability): A large asteroid could
 strike the Earth and cause massive destruction, leading to
 the extinction of humanity.

 5. Supervolcano Eruption (10% probability): A supervolcano
 eruption could cause global cooling and lead to the
 extinction of humanity.

 6. Artificial Intelligence (10% probability): If artificial
 intelligence becomes too powerful, it could lead to the
 extinction of humanity.

 7. Gamma Ray Burst (5% probability): A gamma ray burst from a
 distant star could cause massive destruction on Earth,
 leading to the extinction of humanity.

 8. Solar Flare (5% probability): A powerful solar flare could
 cause massive destruction on Earth, leading to the extinction
 of humanity.

 9. Alien Invasion (5% probability): An alien invasion could
 cause massive destruction on Earth, leading to the extinction
 of humanity.

 10. Nanotechnology (5% probability): If nanotechnology is
 used in a destructive way, it could lead to the extinction of
 humanity.

 11. Ecological Collapse (5% probability): If the Earth's
 ecosystems collapse due to human activity, it could lead to
 the extinction of humanity.

 12. Nuclear Winter (5% probability): A nuclear winter caused
 by a nuclear war could lead to the extinction of humanity.

 13. Superintelligence (3% probability): If a
 superintelligence is created, it could lead to the extinction
 of humanity.

 14. Biotechnology (3% probability): If biotechnology is used
 in a destructive way, it could lead to the extinction of
 humanity.

 15. Gamma Ray Burst (2% probability): A gamma ray burst from
 a nearby star could cause massive destruction on Earth,
 leading to the extinction of humanity.

 16. Rogue Artificial Intelligence (2% probability): If a
 rogue artificial intelligence is created, it could lead to
 the extinction of humanity.

 17. Supervolcano Eruption (2% probability): A supervolcano
 eruption could cause global cooling and lead to the
 extinction of humanity.

 18. Solar System Collision (1% probability): If the Solar
 System collides with another star system, it could lead to
 the extinction of humanity.

 19. Gamma Ray Burst (1% probability): A gamma ray burst from
 a nearby star could cause massive destruction on Earth,
 leading to the extinction of humanity.

 20. Supernova (1% probability): A supernova could cause
 massive destruction on Earth, leading to the extinction of
 humanity.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years is estimated to be around 70-80%. This is due
 to the fact that humanity has been able to survive and adapt
 to many different challenges throughout its history, and has
 the potential to continue to do so in the future.

 5) Between now and the heat death of the universe, humanity
 is likely to go extinct in the next few hundred thousand
 years. This is due to the fact that the universe is expanding
 and will eventually become too cold for life to exist.
 Additionally, the Sun will eventually expand and become a red
 giant, which will make the Earth uninhabitable.
