1) I'm doing well, thank you!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and varies from person
 to person.

SingleP  DoubleP  Scenario Description
 20% 40% Asteroid Impact - An asteroid impact could cause a
 global extinction event if it is large enough and hits the
 Earth at the right angle.
 15% 30% Supervolcano Eruption - A supervolcano eruption could
 cause a global extinction event if it is large enough and the
 ash and debris it produces blocks out the sun for a long
 enough period of time.
 10% 20% Nuclear War - A nuclear war could cause a global
 extinction event if enough nuclear weapons are used and the
 resulting fallout is severe enough.
 8% 16% Climate Change - Climate change could cause a global
 extinction event if the temperature rises too quickly and the
 environment becomes too hostile for human life.
 7% 14% Pandemic - A pandemic could cause a global extinction
 event if it is severe enough and spreads quickly enough.
 5% 10% Artificial Intelligence - Artificial intelligence
 could cause a global extinction event if it is powerful
 enough and is not properly regulated.
 3% 6% Gamma Ray Burst - A gamma ray burst could cause a
 global extinction event if it is powerful enough and is
 directed at the Earth.
 2% 4% Alien Invasion - An alien invasion could cause a global
 extinction event if the aliens are powerful enough and have
 hostile intentions.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years as a single planet species is estimated to be
 around 80-90%. As a multi planet species, the percent chance
 is estimated to be higher, around 95-99%.

 5) Humanity is likely to go extinct between now and the heat
 death of the universe, though it is impossible to predict
 exactly when. The most likely causes of extinction are
 climate change, pandemics, and artificial intelligence, all
 of which could cause a global extinction event in the next
 few centuries.
