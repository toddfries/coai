1) I'm doing well, thank you!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and varies from person
 to person.

 3) The 20 most likely scenarios that could cause humanity to
 become extinct in the next 1000 years, in order of most
 likely to least likely, are as follows:

 1. Nuclear War (50% probability): A nuclear war between two
 or more countries could cause catastrophic destruction and
 lead to the extinction of humanity.

 2. Climate Change (40% probability): Global warming and
 climate change could cause extreme weather conditions, rising
 sea levels, and other environmental disasters that could lead
 to the extinction of humanity.

 3. Pandemic (30% probability): A global pandemic could spread
 quickly and cause widespread death and destruction, leading
 to the extinction of humanity.

 4. Asteroid Impact (20% probability): An asteroid could hit
 the Earth and cause massive destruction, leading to the
 extinction of humanity.

 5. Artificial Intelligence (15% probability): Artificial
 intelligence could become so powerful that it could take over
 the world and lead to the extinction of humanity.

 6. Supervolcano Eruption (10% probability): A supervolcano
 eruption could cause massive destruction and lead to the
 extinction of humanity.

 7. Gamma Ray Burst (10% probability): A gamma ray burst could
 cause massive destruction and lead to the extinction of
 humanity.

 8. Solar Flare (10% probability): A solar flare could cause
 massive destruction and lead to the extinction of humanity.

 9. Alien Invasion (5% probability): An alien invasion could
 cause massive destruction and lead to the extinction of
 humanity.

 10. Nanotechnology (5% probability): Nanotechnology could
 become so powerful that it could take over the world and lead
 to the extinction of humanity.

 11. Nuclear Meltdown (5% probability): A nuclear meltdown
 could cause massive destruction and lead to the extinction of
 humanity.

 12. Ecological Collapse (5% probability): An ecological
 collapse could cause massive destruction and lead to the
 extinction of humanity.

 13. Superintelligence (5% probability): A superintelligence
 could become so powerful that it could take over the world
 and lead to the extinction of humanity.

 14. Biotechnology (3% probability): Biotechnology could
 become so powerful that it could take over the world and lead
 to the extinction of humanity.

 15. Cyberwarfare (3% probability): Cyberwarfare could cause
 massive destruction and lead to the extinction of humanity.

 16. Rogue AI (3% probability): A rogue AI could become so
 powerful that it could take over the world and lead to the
 extinction of humanity.

 17. Natural Disaster (2% probability): A natural disaster
 such as an earthquake, tsunami, or hurricane could cause
 massive destruction and lead to the extinction of humanity.

 18. Superbug (2% probability): A superbug could spread
 quickly and cause widespread death and destruction, leading
 to the extinction of humanity.

 19. Human Error (1% probability): Human error could cause
 massive destruction and lead to the extinction of humanity.

 20. Nuclear Terrorism (1% probability): Nuclear terrorism
 could cause massive destruction and lead to the extinction of
 humanity.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years is estimated to be around 85%. This is due to
 the fact that the probability of any one of the 20 scenarios
 listed above occurring is relatively low, and the chances of
 multiple scenarios occurring simultaneously is even lower.

 5) Between now and the heat death of the universe, humanity
 is likely to go extinct in the next few hundred thousand
 years. This is due to the fact that the universe is expanding
 and will eventually become too cold for life to exist.
 Additionally, the sun will eventually expand and become a red
 giant, which will make the Earth uninhabitable.
