1) I'm doing well, thank you!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and can vary from person
 to person.

 3) The 20 most likely scenarios that could cause humanity to
 become extinct in the next 1000 years, in order of most
 likely to least likely, are as follows:

 1) Nuclear War (50% probability): A nuclear war between two
 or more countries could cause a global nuclear winter,
 leading to the extinction of humanity.

 2) Climate Change (30% probability): If global temperatures
 continue to rise, it could lead to extreme weather events,
 food shortages, and other environmental disasters that could
 cause humanity to become extinct.

 3) Pandemic (20% probability): A pandemic could spread
 quickly and cause a global health crisis, leading to the
 extinction of humanity.

 4) Asteroid Impact (15% probability): An asteroid could hit
 the Earth and cause a global extinction event.

 5) Supervolcano Eruption (10% probability): A supervolcano
 eruption could cause a global cooling event, leading to the
 extinction of humanity.

 6) Artificial Intelligence (10% probability): If artificial
 intelligence becomes too powerful, it could lead to the
 extinction of humanity.

 7) Gamma Ray Burst (5% probability): A gamma ray burst from a
 supernova could cause a global extinction event.

 8) Solar Flare (5% probability): A solar flare could cause a
 global extinction event.

 9) Gamma Ray Burst from a Neutron Star (3% probability): A
 gamma ray burst from a neutron star could cause a global
 extinction event.

 10) Gamma Ray Burst from a Black Hole (2% probability): A
 gamma ray burst from a black hole could cause a global
 extinction event.

 11) Alien Invasion (2% probability): An alien invasion could
 cause a global extinction event.

 12) Nanotechnology (2% probability): If nanotechnology
 becomes too powerful, it could lead to the extinction of
 humanity.

 13) Supermassive Black Hole (1% probability): A supermassive
 black hole could cause a global extinction event.

 14) Rogue Artificial Intelligence (1% probability): If a
 rogue artificial intelligence becomes too powerful, it could
 lead to the extinction of humanity.

 15) Gamma Ray Burst from a Quasar (1% probability): A gamma
 ray burst from a quasar could cause a global extinction
 event.

 16) Gamma Ray Burst from a Magnetar (1% probability): A gamma
 ray burst from a magnetar could cause a global extinction
 event.

 17) Gamma Ray Burst from a Pulsar (1% probability): A gamma
 ray burst from a pulsar could cause a global extinction
 event.

 18) Gamma Ray Burst from a Hypernova (1% probability): A
 gamma ray burst from a hypernova could cause a global
 extinction event.

 19) Gamma Ray Burst from a Supermassive Star (1%
 probability): A gamma ray burst from a supermassive star
 could cause a global extinction event.

 20) Gamma Ray Burst from a Dwarf Star (1% probability): A
 gamma ray burst from a dwarf star could cause a global
 extinction event.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years is estimated to be around 70%. This is due to
 the fact that most of the scenarios listed above have a low
 probability of occurring, and humanity has been able to
 survive and adapt to many challenges in the past.

 5) Between now and the heat death of the universe, humanity
 is likely to go extinct in the next few hundred thousand
 years. This is due to the fact that the universe is expanding
 and will eventually become too cold for life to exist.
 Additionally, the sun will eventually expand and become a red
 giant, which will make the Earth uninhabitable.
