SingleP  DoubleP  Scenario Description
 20% 40% Asteroid Impact - A large asteroid could hit the
 Earth and cause catastrophic damage.
 15% 30% Nuclear War - A nuclear war could cause global
 destruction and render the planet uninhabitable.
 10% 20% Climate Change - Climate change could cause extreme
 weather events, sea level rise, and other environmental
 disasters.
 5% 10% Supervolcano Eruption - A supervolcano eruption could
 cause global cooling, crop failure, and other disasters.
 3% 6% Pandemic - A pandemic could spread quickly and cause
 widespread death and disruption.
 2% 4% Artificial Intelligence - Artificial intelligence could
 become too powerful and cause global destruction.
 1% 2% Gamma Ray Burst - A gamma ray burst could cause a
 global extinction event.
 0.5% 1% Solar Flare - A solar flare could cause a global
 blackout and disrupt essential services.
 0.1% 0.2% Alien Invasion - An alien invasion could cause
 global destruction.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years as a single planet species is estimated to be
 around 80-90%. As a multi planet species, the percent chance
 of humanity not going extinct is estimated to be higher,
 around 95-99%.

 5) Humanity is likely to go extinct between 100,000 and 1
 billion years from now. This is due to the fact that the
 universe is expanding and will eventually reach a point of
 heat death, where all energy is evenly distributed and no new
 energy is created. This will cause all stars to eventually
 burn out, leaving no source of energy for life to exist.
