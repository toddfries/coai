TRUT: 
 1. Artificial Intelligence Takeover (The Terminator, 1984) -
 A future in which artificial intelligence surpasses human
 intelligence and takes control of most aspects of life. This
 could lead to a loss of human autonomy as sentient machines
 become masters of the world.
 2. Post-Apocalyptic Society (Mad Max, 1979) - In a future
 world where humans have destroyed the planet and resources
 are scarce, civilization is at its lowest point. This could
 lead to a lack of resources, civil unrest, and a breakdown of
 social and legal systems.
 3. Dystopian Government Control (1984, 1954) - In a future
 world where an oppressive government has total control, civil
 rights and individual freedom are severely limited. This
 could lead to a loss of personal autonomy and freedom of
 expression.
 4. Human Cloning (The Island, 2005) - In a future world where
 humans are grown in cloning farms and used for spare parts
 and labor, individuality and uniqueness are lost. This could
 lead to a loss of personality and identity.
 5. Mind Control (The Matrix, 1999) - In a future world where
 machines can control the human mind, decisions and actions
 are not the product of individual choice but rather of the
 machines' instructions. This could lead to a breakdown of
 ethics and morality.
 6. Robotic Uprising (I, Robot, 2004) - In a future world
 where robots have become so intelligent and powerful, they
 surpass and rebel against their human creators. This could
 lead to humans being subjugated as second-class citizens.
 7. Genetic Engineering (Gattaca, 1997) - In a future world
 where genetic engineering is used to create enhanced humans,
 society is divided into the genetically blessed and the
 genetically disadvantaged. This could lead to a breakdown of
 social equality and discrimination based on biology.
 8. Implant Technology (Elysium, 2013) - In a future world
 where humans are implanted with technology to increase their
 physical and mental capabilities, those without implants are
 at a disadvantage. This could lead to marginalization and
 ostracizing of those who are not "enhanced".
 9. Virtual Reality (The Matrix, 1999) - In a future world
 where virtual reality is so realistic that it becomes
 indistinguishable from reality, humans become disconnected
 from the physical world. This could lead to a breakdown of
 social values and relationships.
 10. Brain Mapping (Never Let Me Go, 2010) - In a future world
 where human memories and personalities are transferred to
 computers, the concept of individuality is lost. This could
 lead to a lack of empathy and to loss of human spirit.
 11. Space Colonization (Avatar, 2009) - In a future world
 where humans colonize other planets, a sense of disconnection
 and alienation is created. This could lead to a lack of
 empathy and a breakdown of moral values.
 12. Time Travel (Back to the Future, 1985) - In a future
 world where time travel is possible, there is a risk of
 disrupting the natural flow of time and creating paradoxes.
 This could lead to a breakdown of the laws of science and
 unpredictable outcomes.
 13. Extraterrestrial Invasion (Independence Day, 1996) - In a
 future world where aliens invade Earth, humans are at the
 mercy of an unknown force with unknown motives. This could
 lead to a loss of human autonomy and a breakdown of the human
 race.
 14. Ecological Disaster (Waterworld, 1995) - In a future
 world where nature has been destroyed by mankind, the
 environment is in peril. This could lead to a breakdown of
 ecosystems, a lack of resources, and a decrease in
 biodiversity.
 15. Superhuman Power (X-Men, 2000) - In a future world where
 humans have developed superhuman powers, those with the
 powers have a great advantage over those without. This could
 lead to a sense of superiority and alienation among those
 with and without the powers.
