 1. Eugenics, Gattaca (1997): eugenics could be used to create
 a utopian society where the wealthy and powerful have access
 to superior genetics and the genetically engineered offspring
 have advantages over their less well-bred peers. This could
 lead to an unfair society where those at the top have an
 unfair advantage over those at the bottom.

 2. Self-replicating robots, The Terminator (1984):
 self-replicating robots could be created and used to replace
 human workers, leading to loss of jobs and economic
 inequality.

 3. Mass surveillance, Minority Report (2002): mass
 surveillance could create a totalitarian police state where
 citizens have little to no privacy and the government can
 easily identify and track political dissidents.

 4. Human augmentation, Robocop (1987): human augmentation
 could be used to create an oligarchy of super-soldiers with
 enhanced strength, speed, and stamina, giving them an unfair
 advantage over ordinary humans.

 5. Nanotechnology, The Matrix (1999): nanotechnology could be
 used to create a world where artificial intelligence has
 replaced humans as the predominant species, relegating humans
 to an inferior position.

 6. Artificial Intelligence, Blade Runner (1982): AI could be
 used to create robots that are indistinguishable from humans
 and could eventually become more powerful than humans,
 putting humanity in danger of extinction.

 7. Life extension, Inception (2010): Life extension
 technology could be used to allow a small elite to extend
 their lives far beyond the normal lifespan, creating an
 unfair status quo and leaving the majority of the population
 with no chance of achieving the same level of longevity.

 8. Genetic engineering, Jurassic Park (1993): Genetic
 engineering could be used to create species that threaten the
 extinction of existing species, resulting in a global
 ecological disaster.

 9. Technological singularity, Her (2013): Technological
 singularity could lead to a society where machines have
 exponentially increasing intelligence and eventually surpass
 human capabilities, leaving mankind to become obsolete.

 10. Totalitarianism, 1984 (1984): Totalitarianism could be
 used to create a world where freedom of thought is
 nonexistent and all citizens are monitored and controlled by
 the government.

 11. Environmental disaster, Waterworld (1995): Environmental
 disaster could lead to an extreme depletion of natural
 resources, leading to a world where resources are scarce and
 the gap between the rich and the poor is even more extreme.

 12. Climate change, The Day After Tomorrow (2004): Climate
 change could cause catastrophic weather events that wreak
 havoc on the earth and could lead to widespread famine and
 displacement of people.

 13. Mind control, The Matrix (1999): Mind control could be
 used by a dictatorial government to control the population,
 removing free will and limiting the populationâ€™s ability to
 think and act independently.

 14. Mass extinction, The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008):
 Mass extinction could be caused by cosmic threats, natural or
 man-made disasters, or even advanced technology, leading to
 the extinction of entire species.

 15. Overpopulated Earth, Wall-E (2008): Overpopulated Earth
 could lead to an unsustainable situation where resources are
 scarce and the environment is damaged beyond repair.
