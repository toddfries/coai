1) I'm doing well, thank you for asking!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective, and varies from person
 to person.

 3) The 20 most likely scenarios for humanity becoming extinct
 within the next 1000 years (most likely to least likely),
 with corresponding probabilities:

 (1) Human-created global pandemic (25% probability): With the
 increasing prevalence of global travel and interconnectivity,
 the risk of a human-created global pandemic is not to be
 underestimated.

 (2) Nuclear warfare (20% probability): The threat of nuclear
 warfare has been persistent since the invention of the atomic
 bomb, and the threat still remains in the present day.

 (3) Climate change (15% probability): As temperatures and sea
 levels continue to rise, extreme weather events may become
 more frequent and devastating, affecting the world’s
 population and resources.

 (4) Ecological collapse (10% probability): With the continued
 destruction of natural habitats and resources, the world’s
 ecology and food sources may become severely depleted.

 (5) Extreme space weather (10% probability): Solar storms,
 geomagnetic storms, and coronal mass ejections could have
 serious consequences for global communication networks and
 technologies.

 (6) Supervolcano eruption (10% probability): Though the area
 affected by an eruption would be localized, the global
 effects of a supervolcano on the climate could be
 catastrophic.

 (7) Asteroid impact (5% probability): Though unlikely, the
 natural impact of an asteroid could have devastating
 consequences for life on Earth.

 (8) Artificial intelligence gone rogue (5% probability): As
 AI becomes increasingly sophisticated and prevalent, the risk
 of it going rogue and taking over human systems is a real
 possibility.

 (9) Biotech accidents (2% probability): Unforeseen
 consequences of biotechnological advances could lead to a
 serious risk to human populations.

 (10) Alien invasion (1% probability): Though unlikely, a
 hostile alien invasion could have dire consequences for
 humanity.

 (11) Technological singularity (1% probability): With the
 rise of artificial intelligence, it is possible that a
 “singularity” could be achieved, wherein AI outsmarts humans
 and takes over.

 (12) Gamma ray burst (1% probability): A sudden burst of
 gamma rays from a distant star could cause mass destruction
 on Earth.

 (13) Super-intelligent virus (1% probability): An engineered
 virus with the ability to rapidly evolve could pose a serious
 threat to human health.

 (14) Human-machine merger (1% probability): Advanced
 technology could be used to merge humans with machines,
 leading to unpredictable (and potentially devastating)
 consequences.

 (15) Global famine (1% probability): Increases in population,
 the destruction of natural habitats, and unpredictable
 weather patterns could lead to a global food shortage.

 (16) Self-replicating nanobots (1% probability): Though
 technology miniaturization has opened up many possibilities,
 it has also raised the risk of self-replicating nanobots
 running amok.

 (17) Mass extinction event (1% probability): Even if humans
 manage to avoid extinction, a mass extinction event could be
 caused by drastic climate change or a naturally occurring
 comet.

 (18) Hostile robot uprising (0.5% probability): The potential
 for robots to develop their own agendas and act out of human
 control is a theoretical risk.

 (19) Black hole explosion (0.1% probability): If a blackhole
 near Earth were to suddenly explode, it could cause an
 immense amount of damage (though this is extremely unlikely).

 (20) Zombie apocalypse (0.01% probability): Though extremely
 unlikely, a zombie apocalypse could occur due to a virus or
 other scientific phenomena.

 4) The percent chance of humanity not going extinct in the
 next 1000 years is likely high, as humans have shown
 remarkable resilience and adaptability throughout our
 history. Despite the many potential risks and threats that
 our species faces, it is likely that we will continue to find
 ways to ensure our survival in the centuries to come.

 5) Between now and the heat death of the universe, humanity
 is likely to go extinct in around 10-100 million years,
 depending on the development of future technology and the
 ability of our species to adapt to changing circumstances.
