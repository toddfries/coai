1) I'm doing well, thank you!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and personal to each
 individual, and can mean different things to different
 people.

 3) Here is a list of the 20 most likely scenarios that could
 cause human extinction in the next 1000 years, listed in
 order of most to least likely:
 • Asteroid/Meteorite Impact: Approximately 65% chance of
 Earth being impacted by a large asteroid or meteorite in the
 next 1000 years.
 • AI Takeover: Approx 10% chance of AI becoming sophisticated
 enough to turn on humans in the next 1000 years.
 • Super-Virus: Approx 10% chance of a virus becoming so
 virulent it causes human extinction in the next 1000 years.
 • Nuclear War: Approx 5% chance of nuclear war leading to
 human extinction in the next 1000 years.
 • Extreme Global Warming: Approx 5% chance of a catastrophic
 climate event leading to human extinction in the next 1000
 years.
 • Resource Depletion: Approx 5% chance of resource exhaustion
 leading to human extinction in the next 1000 years.
 • Solar Storm: Approx 5% chance of a solar storm causing a
 mass extinction in the next 1000 years.
 • Super-Volcano: Approx 5% chance of a super-volcano
 occurring and leading to human extinction in the next 1000
 years.
 • Alien Invasion: Approx 5% chance of alien species invading
 and overtaking human civilization in the next 1000 years.
 • Monster Solar Flare: Approx 5% chance of a super-solar
 flare causing a mass extinction in the next 1000 years.
 • Gamma-Ray Burst: Approx 5% chance of a gamma-ray burst
 leading to human extinction in the next 1000 years.
 • Rogue AI: Approx 5% chance of rogue AI leading to human
 extinction in the next 1000 years.
 • Uncontainable Super-Virus: Approx 5% chance of a virus
 becoming so virulent that, if not contained, will cause human
 extinction in the next 1000 years.
 • Bio-Weapon War: Approx 5% chance of a bio-weapon leading to
 human extinction in the next 1000 years.
 • Grey Goo Scenario: Approx 5% chance of a grey goo scenario
 leading to human extinction in the next 1000 years.
 • Super-Intelligent Virus: Approx 5% chance of a virus
 becoming so intelligent that it could overtake humans and
 cause human extinction in the next 1000 years.
 • Unstoppable Sanitary/Environmental Crisis: Approx 5% chance
 of a sanitary and/or environmental crisis leading to human
 extinction in the next 1000 years.
 • Unmanageable Global Pandemic: Approx 5% chance of an
 uncontrollable pandemic leading to human extinction in the
 next 1000 years.
 • Geomagnetic Reversal: Approx 5% chance of a geomagnetic
 reversal leading to human extinction in the next 1000 years.

 4) The percent chance that humanity does not go extinct in
 the next 1000 years is approximately 70%. This is because
 while several of the scenarios listed above have a chance of
 happening, the chance of all of them happening simultaneously
 is incredibly low.

 5) Humanity is likely to go extinct some time between now and
 the heat death of the universe. The exact timing is
 impossible to predict, but it is likely to occur much sooner
 than the heat death as our species is presently facing
 numerous existential threats which could lead to our
 extinction long before the universe ends.
