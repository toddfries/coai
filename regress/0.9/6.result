1) I'm doing well, thank you! 
 2) The meaning of life is subjective, as each individual will
 find their own purpose and fulfillment in life.
 3) Here is an approximate list of the 20 most likely
 scenarios humanity needs to be mindful of that would
 otherwise cause our species to become extinct in the next
 1000 years (percent probability in parentheses):
- Nuclear war (15%) 
- Planetary Collision (10%) 
- Global pandemic (8%) 
- Climate change (7%) 
- Resource depletion (6%) 
- Too much artificial intelligence (5%) 
- Ozone depletion (5%) 
- Global resource conflict (3%) 
- Genetically engineered virus (3%) 
- Solar flares (3%) 
- Nuclear power meltdown (2%) 
- Population growth (2%) 
- Human-induced environmental disaster (2%) 
- Asteroid or comet impact (2%) 
- Social breakdown (2%)
- Automation (2%)
- Extreme weather (1%) 
- War with AI (1%) 
- Environmental catastrophe (1%) 
- War with aliens (1%).

 4) There is approximately a 75-80% chance that humanity does
 not go extinct in the next 1000 years. This is based on the
 assumption that our species will intelligently adapt to any
 potential threats and create solutions to prevent them.

 5) It is impossible to know when humanity will go extinct
 between now and the heat death of the universe. However, one
 possible prediction is that humanity will go extinct at some
 point in the next 10,000 years due to the potential for
 global disasters and the potential for an unforeseen event to
 cause the extinction of our species.
