 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years as a single planet species is estimated to be
 around 80%. As a multi planet species, the chances of
 humanity surviving is estimated to be around 95%. The primary
 factors contributing to this include increasing access to
 space exploration and travel, technological advancements in
 renewable energy, and more effective cooperation between
 nations.

 5) The best guess for when humanity will go extinct is
 between 5 and 10 billion years from now, when the sun will
 eventually burn out. This is due to the fact that the current
 estimated age of the universe is 13.8 billion years and the
 average lifespan of stars like the sun is 10 billion years.
