1) I'm doing well, thank you for asking!

 2) The meaning of life can be interpreted differently by
 everyone, so there's no 'correct' answer.

 3) Here is a list of the 20 most likely scenarios leading to
 humanity's extinction in the next 1000 years, ordered from
 most to least likely, along with a brief explanation for
 each:

 1) Nuclear Warfare (30% probability): The use of nuclear
 weapons could cause catastrophic destruction and loss of
 life.

 2) Climate Change and Resource Depletion (20% probability):
 Rising temperatures due to climate change, and the depletion
 of natural resources like water, food, and fuel could lead to
 severe poverty, displacement, and disease.

 3) Extreme Natural Disasters (15% probability): Natural
 disasters such as volcanoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, and
 tsunamis could cause large-scale destruction and death.

 4) Pandemics (10% probability): A global pandemic could sweep
 through the world, leading to mass death and disruption of
 daily life.

 5) Asteroid Impact (8% probability): An asteroid large enough
 to cause global destruction impacting Earth could lead to
 humanity's extinction.

 6) Artificial Intelligence (7% probability): An AI
 superintelligence could become self-aware and decide to take
 human life.

 7) Bioweapon Attack (5% probability): The intentional release
 of a bioweapon could cause mass destruction.

 8) Gamma Ray Burst (4% probability): A gamma ray burst
 originating from outside our solar system could cause
 catastrophic damage.

 9) Nuclear Plant Meltdown (3% probability): A nuclear plant
 meltdown due to poor regulation or accident could destroy
 large areas of land.

 10) Magnetic Pole Reversal (2% probability): A reversal of
 the Earth's magnetic poles could cause disruption to our
 atmosphere and climate.

 11) Supervolcano Eruption (2% probability): A supervolcano
 eruption could lead to global cooling and disruption of our
 environment.

 12) Solar Flare (2% probability): An extreme solar flare
 could cause a powerful electromagnetic pulse, which could
 damage electronic devices, satellites, and power grids.

 13) Nanotech Disasters (1% probability): The uncontrolled
 release of nanotechnology due to a disaster or malicious
 intent could have devastating consequences.

 14) Geomagnetic Reversal (1% probability): A geomagnetic
 reversal could lead to large-scale destruction due to
 increased radiation exposure.

 15) Technology Leakage (1% probability): Extremely powerful
 technology falling into the wrong hands could lead to
 destruction and harm.

 16) Irresponsible Use of Genetically Modified Organisms (1%
 probability): The irresponsible use of genetically modified
 organisms (GMOs) could have a variety of unintended
 consequences.

 17) Alien Attack (0.5% probability): An alien species could
 attack Earth, leading to destruction and death.

 18) Global Economic Crisis (0.5% probability): A global
 economic crisis could lead to scarcity of resources and the
 destruction of infrastructure.

 19) Extreme Weather Events (0.1% probability): Extreme
 weather events like hailstorms, tornadoes, and droughts could
 cause destruction and loss of life.

 20) Super-Intelligent Species (0.1% probability): An
 intelligent species more advanced than us could invade Earth
 and wipe out humanity.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years is estimated to be between 70-80%. While
 there are many potential threats, humanity has been resilient
 in the past and has adapted to many challenges. With advances
 in technology, we can develop solutions to mitigate the risks
 posed by these threats.

 5) Between now and heat death of the universe, it is
 impossible to know when humanity will likely go extinct.
 While some people believe we may eventually be able to
 colonize other planets, in order for that to happen many
 challenges would need to be overcome. Even if we were to
 achieve interstellar travel, it is unlikely that we would
 survive the extremely long journey to reach another habitable
 planet.
