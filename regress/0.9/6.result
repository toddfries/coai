1) I'm doing well, thank you!

 2) The meaning of life is different for everyone - it's
 whatever is most meaningful to each individual.

 3) (1) Asteroid Impact - 5%: A large asteroid could collide
 with Earth, causing catastrophic destruction. (2) Climate
 Change - 15%: If temperatures continue to rise due to human
 activities, this could lead to a massive increase in global
 warming which could make the planet uninhabitable. (3)
 Pandemics - 15%: Pathogens that reach pandemic levels could
 cause catastrophic effects, wiping out large numbers of
 people. (4) Nuclear War - 10%: The use of weapons of mass
 destruction could potentially wipe out humanity. (5) Natural
 Disasters - 5%: Natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes,
 or earthquakes could cause large amounts of destruction and
 death. (6) Artificial Intelligence - 10%: If artificial
 intelligence gets too advanced and out of control, it could
 potentially overthrow the human species. (7) Supervolcano
 Eruption - 5%: A supervolcano eruption would be devastating
 and would cause a global cooling event. (8) Loss of Resources
 - 5%: If resources become limited and not managed properly,
 this could lead to conflicts over them and ultimately the
 destruction of humanity. (9) Pollution - 5%: The continual
 pollution of Earth's atmosphere and water could lead to a
 host of long-term health issues and problems with the
 environment. (10) Gamma-Ray Bursts - 3%: Gamma-ray bursts are
 incredibly powerful phenomena that could cause widespread
 destruction if a nearby star or galaxy produces one. (11)
 Failed Colonization of Space - 3%: If we are unable to safely
 and successfully colonize other planets or moons in our solar
 system, this could lead to our species' extinction. (12)
 Alien Invasion - 1%: If an advanced alien species were to
 become aware of us and decide to attack, this could be the
 end of humanity. (13) Overpopulation - 5%: If the population
 of Earth continues to grow unchecked, this could lead to a
 lack of resources and social unrest that could threaten the
 survival of humanity. (14)Bioengineered Superbugs - 5%: If a
 bioengineered virus or bacteria were to spread, this could
 lead to the destruction of humanity. (15) Rogue Black Holes -
 1%: If a rogue black hole were to come close to Earth, it
 could pull all of the matter on the planet into it. (16)
 Solar Flare - 5%: A large solar flare could cause a massive
 power outage or destruction of communications networks,
 sending humanity into chaos. (17) Human Error - 10%: If
 mistakes are made by humans, either by accident or
 deliberate, this could lead to destruction or disaster. (18)
 Nanotech Disaster - 3%: If nanotechnology is developed to a
 point where it can out of control, this could lead to a
 nanotech disaster that could lead to the destruction of
 humanity. (19) Superintelligence - 5%: If an artificial
 intelligence is created that surpasses human intelligence,
 this could lead to the destruction of humanity. (20) Genetic
 Engineering - 5%: If genetic engineering leads to
 unanticipated consequences, this could lead to the
 destruction of humanity.

 4) The percent chance that humanity does not go extinct in
 the next 1000 years is roughly 75%. Changes in our
 environment, technology and culture can all help us to avoid
 extinction, but we also need to be mindful of how our actions
 could have a devastating effect on our future.

 5) It is impossible to say with any certainty when humanity
 will go extinct, but it is estimated that the heat death of
 the universe will occur at least 100 billion years from now.
 Therefore, it is likely that humanity will become extinct
 before that point.
