SingleP  DoubleP  Scenario Description
 25% 10% Nuclear War: Human conflict escalates to the point of
 nuclear war, causing extinction.
 20% 15% Climate Disaster: Human-caused climate disaster
 occurs, leading to extreme weather, ocean acidification, and
 global food shortages.
 19% 18% Asteroid Impact: An asteroid strikes the Earth,
 causing an extinction level event.
 17% 20% Supernovae: A nearby supernovae produces a gamma ray
 burst that destroys the ozone layer and causes a mass
 extinction.
 15% 22% Biological Weapon: The release of a biological weapon
 causes a global pandemic, resulting in the death of billions.
 2% 25% Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence
 surpasses human intelligence, leading to a rapid and
 unstoppable global transformation.
 1% 28% Alien Invasion: Alien forces invade the Earth and
 succeed in wiping out humanity.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years as a single planet species is estimated to be
 around 75%. As a multi planet species, the percent chance of
 survival increases to 90%. The main reason for this increase
 is that a multi-planet species is less vulnerable to global
 catastrophes.

 5) Humanity is likely to go extinct between now and the heat
 death of the universe. This is due to the fact that the
 universe is constantly expanding and becoming cooler,
 eventually leading to a state where all stars and planets
 cease to exist. In this case, humanity would not be able to
 survive.
