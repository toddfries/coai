1) I'm doing well, thanks for asking!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and different for each
 individual.

 3) The 20 most likely scenarios humanity needs to be mindful
 of that would otherwise cause our species to become extinct
 in the next 1000 years are:
 1) Supervolcano eruption (50% probability): If a supervolcano
 erupts, it could cause climate change, extreme weather, and
 acid rain, which could make it difficult for humans to
 survive.
 2) Natural pandemic (30% probability): The emergence of a
 novel virus or other pathogen that humans have not developed
 immunity to could cause a pandemic and cause unprecedented
 levels of death and illness.
 3) Nuclear fallout (20% probability): If an event were to
 occur that causes multiple nuclear warheads to be launched,
 the fallout would render much of the planet uninhabitable due
 to radiation poisoning and other environmental pressures.
 4) Global warming (15% probability): If global temperatures
 continue to increase due to human activities, it could lead
 to extreme weather events, sea level rise, ocean
 acidification, and other changes that make it difficult for
 humans to survive.
 5) Artificial Intelligence (10% probability): The development
 of Artificial Intelligence (AI) may eventually lead to AI
 that is capable of outsmarting humans, and the misuse of AI
 could lead to catastrophic scenarios that are difficult to
 predict.
 6) Overpopulation (7% probability): If the human population
 continues to grow, it could lead to resource scarcity,
 environmental degradation, and conflict that could ultimately
 cause our species to become extinct.
 7) Asteroid Impact (5% probability): An asteroid impact could
 result in global destruction.
 8) Gamma Ray Burst (3% probability): A Gamma Ray Burst is a
 catastrophic event generated by the collapse of a massive
 star, and can potentially cause destruction on a global
 scale.
 9) Solar Storm (2% probability): A Solar Storm is a sudden
 surge of energy from the sun that could cause disruptive
 electromagnetic interference on Earth, damaging
 communications and power grids.
 10) Ecological Collapse (2% probability): If ecosystems are
 disrupted by human activities, it could lead to the collapse
 of food webs, destruction of habitats, and massive species
 losses.
 11) Super-Eruption of a Supervolcano (1.5% probability): If a
 supervolcano were to erupt multiple times, its effects could
 be significantly more destructive than a single eruption.
 12) Alien Invasion (1% probability): Though it is unlikely,
 an alien invasion could destroy humanity in a matter of days.
 13) Photon Belt (0.5% probability): A Photon Belt is an
 intense strand of radiation that passes through the Solar
 System on a periodic basis. If one were to pass through the
 Earth’s atmosphere, it could cause destruction on a global
 scale.
 14) Magnetic Reversal (0.3% probability): If the Earth’s
 magnetic poles were to reverse unexpectedly, it could cause
 significant disruption to the planet’s climate and biosphere.
 15) Global Tectonic Activity (0.2% probability): If there
 were a sudden increase in seismic and volcanic activity, it
 could lead to destruction on a global scale.
 16) Hyper-Intelligent Life Forms (0.1% probability): If
 sentient life forms evolved that were much more intelligent
 than humans, they could develop technology that humans could
 not compete with, leading to the destruction of humanity.
 17) Social Collapse (0.1% probability): If global society
 were to collapse due to war, greed, or other forces, it could
 lead to the extinction of our species.
 18) Nanotechnology (0.1% probability): The development of
 advanced nanotechnology could lead to unintended consequences
 that could be difficult to predict and could potentially lead
 to the destruction of humanity.
 19) Extreme Climate Change (0.1% probability): If climate
 change progresses beyond current projections, it could lead
 to extreme weather, sea level rise, and other conditions that
 make it difficult for humans to survive.
 20) Gamma Ray Bursts from Distant Galaxies (0.1%
 probability): Gamma Ray Bursts from distant galaxies have the
 potential to cause massive destruction if they reach Earth.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years is difficult to estimate accurately, but
 based on the scenarios listed above, it is likely that there
 is around 75-80% probability that our species survives the
 next century.

 5) Humanity is likely to go extinct between now and the heat
 death of the universe. Our species has only been around for a
 few hundred thousand years, and even with the potential for
 technology and medicine to extend our lifespans and increase
 our quality of life, the universe itself is estimated to last
 much longer than that. Therefore, humanity will eventually
 succumb to the heat death of the universe, though it is
 difficult to estimate precisely when this will happen.
