1) I'm doing well, thank you!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and personal. Everyone
 has their own unique interpretation of what the meaning of
 life is.

3) 

 1) War (e.g. nuclear conflict, large-scale resource wars,
 bioweapons, etc) - 80% likelihood
 2) Climate change (e.g. global warming, extreme weather
 events, environmental destruction, etc) - 75% likelihood
 3) Pandemic (e.g. deadly virus, drug-resistant bacteria, etc)
 - 60% likelihood
 4) Self-destructive behavior (e.g. overpopulation, resource
 depletion, pollution, etc) - 55% likelihood
 5) Artificial intelligence (e.g. hostile AI, runaway AI, etc)
 - 55% likelihood
 6) Asteroid impact (e.g. massive collision with Earth, etc) -
 35% likelihood
 7) Solar flare (e.g. large-scale radiation burst, etc) - 30%
 likelihood
 8) Gamma ray burst (e.g. gamma ray energy released by
 exploding stars, etc) - 25% likelihood
 9) Super-eruption (e.g. massive volcanic eruption, etc) - 20%
 likelihood
 10) Super-volcano eruption (e.g. large-scale eruption of
 magma, etc) - 15% likelihood
 11) World government collapse (e.g. dictatorship takeover,
 political turmoil, etc) - 15% likelihood
 12) Alien invasion (e.g. hostile extraterrestrials, etc) -
 10% likelihood
13) Robotics (e.g. robot uprising, etc) - 8% likelihood
14) Nuclear accident (e.g. meltdown, etc) - 7% likelihood
 15) Geological instability (e.g. earthquakes, tectonic
 shifts, etc) - 5% likelihood
16) Electromagnetic pulse (e.g. EMP, etc) - 4% likelihood
 17) Solar system change (e.g. solar system migration, etc) -
 2% likelihood
 18) Extreme Solar Heat (e.g. change in sun's luminosity, etc)
 - 2% likelihood
 19) Terrestrial impact (e.g. large-scale collision with
 Earth, etc) - 1% likelihood
 20) Natural black hole (e.g. self-generating black hole, etc)
 - 0.01% likelihood

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years is difficult to accurately calculate, as
 there are many unpredictable variables and events that could
 potentially threaten our existence. However, based on current
 global trends, it is likely that humanity will survive for at
 least 1000 years.

 5) The exact timing of humanity's ultimate extinction is
 difficult to predict. As the universe continues to expand, it
 is likely that humanity will eventually become extinct due to
 the increasing difficulty of sustaining life on Earth. This
 could occur anywhere from hundreds of millions to billions of
 years in the future when the universe eventually reaches its
 heat death.
