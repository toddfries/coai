1) I'm doing well, thanks for asking!

 2) The meaning of life is a deeply personal and subjective
 concept that differs for each individual.

 3) The 20 most likely scenarios for human extinction within
 the next 1000 years, in descending order of probability, and
 with a brief explanation for each:

 (1) Natural pandemic (60%) - If a highly contagious,
 genetically engineered virus were to spread unchecked, humans
 could be wiped out.

 (2) War (20%) - Human conflict continues to be a major threat
 to our species.

 (3) Artificial Intelligence (10%) - If AI were to become
 advanced enough to be self-aware and to be beyond our
 control, the result could be catastrophic.

 (4) Asteroid Impact (5%) - A large asteroid could strike
 Earth and wipe out human life.

 (5) Environmental Catastrophe (3%) - Climate change and other
 environmental disasters, combined with human negligence,
 could render our planet uninhabitable.

 (6) Supervolcano Eruption (3%) - A supervolcano eruption
 could cause global catastrophic environmental and economic
 damage.

 (7) Gamma-Ray Burst (2%) - If a powerful enough Gamma-ray
 burst were to occur, it could cause mass extinction on Earth.

 (8) Solar Storm (1%) - A powerful solar storm could cause
 widespread electrical disruptions and damage.

 (9) Biological Weapon (1%) - An engineered virus or bacteria
 could be released by terrorists or rogue states, causing
 widespread devastation.

 (10) Global Warming (1%) - If global temperatures were to
 rise too drastically, it could cause human and animal species
 to die off due to desertification and other factors.

 (11) Advanced Nanotechnology (1%) - If nanotechnology were to
 become too advanced and beyond our control, it could lead to
 the extinction of the human species.

 (12) Particle Accelerator Accident (0.5%) - If a particle
 accelerator were to malfunction, it could cause a deadly
 explosion.

 (13) Nuclear War (0.5%) - If a nuclear war were to break out,
 it could cause a global, nuclear winter.

 (14) Near-Earth Object Impact (0.5%) - If an asteroid or
 comet struck Earth, it could cause global destruction.

 (15) Supermassive Black Hole Explosion (0.5%) - If a
 supermassive black hole were to explode, it could devastate
 the Earth.

 (16) Orbital Decompression (0.5%) - If the orbit of Earth
 were to become too elliptical, it could cause catastrophic
 flooding or drought.

 (17) Biological Evolution (0.05%) - If a species were to
 evolve that was hostile to humans and that was resistant to
 our attempts at eradication, it could spell our doom.

 (18) Stellar Collision (0.01%) - If two stars were to collide
 in our galaxy, it could cause immense destruction.

 (19) Extraterrestrial Civilisation Invasion (0.001%) - If an
 advanced alien species were to invade Earth, it could spell
 our end.

 (20) Extraterrestrial Civilisation Attack (0.0001%) - If an
 advanced alien species were to attack Earth, it could again
 spell our end.

 4) The percent chance humanity does not go extinct in the
 next 1000 years is roughly 95%, assuming that humanity takes
 sufficient steps to mitigate the threats listed above.

 5) Between now and the heat death of the universe, humanity
 is likely to go extinct some time in the distant future,
 probably after many thousands or even millions of years have
 passed. The exact time of human extinction will depend on
 numerous factors, such as advances in technology, our ability
 to colonize space, and how well we can manage the threats
 posed by the scenarios listed above.
