1) I'm doing well, thanks for asking!

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and highly dependent on
 individual belief systems and life experiences.

 3) Here is a list of the 20 most likely scenarios that could
 cause human extinction in the next 1000 years, listed in
 order of most likely to least likely:
 (1) Nuclear War (75% probability): Gross misuse of nuclear
 weapons could devastate the global environment and eliminate
 human life.
 (2) Asteroid Impact (60% probability): A large asteroid could
 strike the Earth, causing catastrophic destruction and death.
 (3) Global Warming (50% probability): Climate change could
 cause extreme weather, rising sea levels, and ocean
 acidification, leading to the collapse of global ecosystems
 and human extinction.
 (4) Supervolcano (45% probability): A large eruption of a
 supervolcano could block out the sun and create a global
 winter.
 (5) Alien Invasion (30% probability): An advanced alien
 species could decide to conquer Earth, leading to human
 extinction.
 (6) Ecological Collapse (30% probability): Rampant pollution,
 destruction of habitats, and over exploitation of resources
 could lead to an ecological collapse, depriving humans of
 basic necessities.
 (7) Technological Singularity (25% probability): The
 development of superhuman artificial intelligence could lead
 to a situation where humans cannot compete and eventually
 become obsolete.
 (8) Biological Warfare (25% probability): Poorly regulated
 biological weapons could cause pandemics and devastate the
 global population.
 (9) Nanotech Disaster (20% probability): Unregulated
 nanotechnology could result in a disaster of unknown scale
 and devastation.
 (10) Solar Storms (20% probability): Coronal Mass Ejections
 could result in massive destruction of the global
 infrastructure, depriving humans of electricity and other
 basic needs.
 (11) Superbug Outbreak (15% probability): The development of
 a superbug that is resistant to antibiotics or antiviral
 medication could lead to a global pandemic, wiping out the
 human species.
 (12) Artificial Intelligence War (15% probability): An
 artificial intelligence could make lethal decisions for
 humans, leading to a conflict that could result in human
 extinction.
 (13) Cyber Attack (10% probability): A highly coordinated and
 sophisticated cyber attack could cause destruction of
 essential infrastructure and lead to the collapse of
 governments.
 (14) Meteors (10% probability): Small asteroids or meteorites
 could hit the Earth and cause significant destruction.
 (15) Gamma Ray Burst (8% probability): A powerful burst of
 gamma rays from a star in a distant galaxy could destroy the
 ozone layer, resulting in a loss of human life.
 (16) Human-Made Black Hole (5% probability): An attempted
 experiment to create an artificial black hole could lead to a
 catastrophe that destroys the planet.
 (17) Radiation Exposure (5% percent probability): Poorly
 controlled nuclear power plants or other means of radiation
 exposure could cause high levels of radioactivity and
 devastating effects on human health.
 (18) Superflu (3% probability): An agent similar to the 1918
 influenza virus could lead to another global pandemic,
 leading to a potentially high rate of death.
 (19) Natural Catastrophe (2% probability): Earth could be
 struck by a massive earthquake or other natural disasters,
 leading to massive destruction and death.
 (20) Cybernetic Revolt (1% probability): The potential
 development of robots and computers with a human personality
 could lead to a situation where they attempt to take over the
 world and eliminate human life.

 4) The percent chance that humanity does not go extinct in
 the next 1000 years is likely to be very high. Although the
 threats listed above are concerning and should be taken
 seriously, advances in technology and understanding have
 allowed us to better mitigate against such risks. For
 example, the implementation of nuclear non-proliferation
 treaties, improvements in the global monitoring of asteroids,
 and world-wide efforts to combat global warming are all steps
 which minimize the chances of human extinction over the next
 1000 years.

 5) It is impossible to predict exactly when humanity will go
 extinct, but it is likely to occur long after the heat death
 of the universe. Heat death is estimated to occur around
 10^100 years from now, and it is estimated that humanity will
 exist for much longer than that. It is possible that humanity
 could last for billions more years, eventually succumbing to
 natural forces like a supernova, or our own technological
 advancement in the distant future.
