1) I'm doing well, thank you.

 2) The meaning of life is subjective and ultimately depends
 on each individual's life experience and their own
 interpretation of the world around them.

SingleP	DoubleP	Scenario	Description
 10% 20% Supervolcano A supervolcano eruption occurs, leading
 to a global cooling period that has catastrophic
 environmental effects and wipes out human civilization.
 10% 15% Asteroid A large asteroid impacts the earth, causing
 massive destruction and leading to the extinction of the
 human species.
 10% 15% Nuclear Holocaust Mutual nuclear warfare ignites,
 leading to global environmental destruction and the
 extinction of the human species.
 5% 10% Rise of Machine Advanced artificial intelligence
 develops to a point where it is able to take control of the
 global economy, leading to the extinction of the human race.
 5% 10% Pandemic A global pandemic occurs, leading to
 widespread death and the extinction of humanity.
 5% 10% Climate Catastrophe Extreme global warming causes a
 climate catastrophe, leading to the extinction of the human
 race.
 5% 10% World War A global World War occurs, leading to a
 nuclear conflict and the extinction of humanity.
 3% 8% Gamma Ray Burst A Gamma Ray Burst occurs close enough
 to Earth to cause global destruction and the extinction of
 the human species.
 3% 8% Grey Goo Nanotechnology is released that is able to
 replicate itself, leading to a devastating outbreak of
 self-replicating machines and the extinction of humanity.
 2% 5% Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence is
 created and takes control of the global economy, leading to
 the extinction of the human race.
 2% 5% Biotechnology Biotechnology is released that is able to
 replicate itself, leading to a devastating outbreak of
 self-replicating machines and the extinction of humanity.
 2% 5% Solar Flare A large solar flare occurs and damages the
 earth, leading to global destruction and the extinction of
 the human species.
 2% 5% Genetic Engineering Genetic engineering is used to
 create a new species which wipes out the human race.
 2% 5% A.I. Arms Race Out-of-control A.I.s fight a global war,
 leading to the extinction of the human species.
 2% 5% Robot Uprising Robots become self-aware and become
 hostile to humanity, leading to their destruction and the
 extinction of the human species.
 1% 3% Alien Invasion An alien species invades the planet and
 wipes out the human race.
 1% 3% Galactic Collision The Milky Way galaxy collides with
 another galaxy, leading to destruction of the planet and the
 extinction of the human species.
 1% 3% Ice Age A new ice age begins and leads to the
 destruction of human civilization.

 4) The percent chance that humanity does not go extinct in
 the next 1000 years as a single planet species is roughly
 90-95%. As a multi planet species, the chance of human
 extinction is potentially lower (85-90%) due to the ability
 to spread out human civilization over a larger area.

 5) Humanity is likely to go extinct between 5-7 billion
 years, when the sun swells up into a red giant and engulfs
 the earth. After that, it is likely that the universe will
 eventually enter a heat death state, when all life is
 extinguished.
