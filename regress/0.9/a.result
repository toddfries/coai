TRUT:
 1. Metropolis (1927) – the concept of robots and automation
 in a futuristic society has become a reality, producing
 labor-saving devices, medical robots, and self-driving cars.
 2. War of the Worlds (1953) – space exploration and
 exploration of other planets is now possible thanks to
 advances in space travel and technology.
 3. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) – while we don't yet have
 fully functional Artificial Intelligence, we now have AI in
 the form of voice-recognition software, facial recognition
 and more.
 4. Blade Runner (1982) – advances in genetic engineering are
 now possible, allowing for gene-specific therapies for
 diseases and genetic manipulation of organisms.
 5. The Terminator (1984) – AI-powered drones and military
 robots are now a reality, performing missions that would
 otherwise be too dangerous for deployed soldiers.
 6. The Matrix (1999) – Augmented Reality or AR, which
 superimposes computer-generated images onto a user's view of
 the real world, is now being used in many applications, from
 industrial inspection to gaming.
 7. Minority Report (2002) – gesture-based user interfaces in
 computers and mobile devices, originally popularized in the
 movie, are now common.
 8. The Island (2005) – cloning of animals, and potentially
 humans, is now possible thanks to advances in genetics,
 biotechnology and cloning.
 9. Avatar (2009) – robotics and machine learning have
 advanced to the point where they can control autonomous
 vehicles in dangerous environments, such as deep sea
 exploration.
 10. Inception (2010) – advances in neuroscience and
 psychology are enabling scientists to study the power of our
 subconscious by exploring lucid dreaming and the ability to
 control dreams.

 revolution 4.0 have enabled mass production of products from
 3D-printed parts.
 12. Her (2013) – speech-recognition software, highly advanced
 AI and natural language processing are now commonplace,
 enabling users to interact with computer programs as if they
 were a real person.
 13. Chappie (2015) – advances in robotics, machine learning
 and artificial intelligence are now being used to create
 robots that can think for themselves.
 14. Ex Machina (2015) – advances in facial recognition
 technology and machine learning algorithms now enable
 computer programs to accurately identify people from a photo
 or a video.
 15. Ready Player One (2018) – virtual reality (VR) has become
 widespread, allowing users to explore and interact with
 immersive 3D environments.
