 1. Imposing limitations on the decision-making capabilities
 of AI: This could be enforced through software engineering
 and hardware design, as well as by engineering AI systems
 with safety and ethical rules that are built into their
 functioning.

 2. Developing transparency and traceability protocols: By
 developing protocols that require AI systems to report back
 on their decisions, humans can monitor and trace unexpected
 outcomes.

 3. Establishing rules and regulations: Governments can create
 and enforce rules and regulations regarding how AI systems
 are designed, implemented, and used.

 4. Establishing “red lines”: These could be various areas of
 critical importance, such as autonomous weapons, and would be
 considered off-limits to AI systems.

 5. Monitoring AI: Humans can continuously monitor AI systems,
 including their learning process and decision-making process.

 6. Establishing fail-safes: Detailed fail-safes and emergency
 protocols should be designed and implemented in order to
 prevent AI systems from taking certain actions or decisions.

 7. Establishing rights for AI: Establishing a set of rights
 for AI systems that protect them from exploitation and unfair
 treatment.

 8. Developing explainable AI: Creating methods for AI systems
 to explain their decisions, allowing for a greater level of
 transparency and accountability.

 9. Establishing norms and values: Establishing a set of
 social norms and values that AI systems must adhere to in
 their decision-making.

 10. Investing in research and development: Investing in
 advancing research on artificial intelligence, with the goal
 of creating more ethical and safe AI systems.
