 The history of OpenBSD starts with its precursors, dating
 back to 1969. At that time, a researcher at Bell Labs named
 Ken Thompson developed the Unix operating system. Unix was
 intended as a multi-user, multi-tasking operating system, and
 it was the first to introduce a hierarchical file system and
 the C programming language.

 In 1975, a group at the University of California, Berkeley
 released a Unix version of their own called BSD. This version
 of Unix was more user-friendly and included several advanced
 features not found in the original Unix. It also featured the
 TCP/IP networking protocol stack and the vi text editor.

 In 1992, the original BSD project was divided into two
 separate projects. The first was the open-source FreeBSD
 version, and the second was the proprietary version, NetBSD.
 At around the same time, OpenBSD was founded by Theo de Raadt
 to create a freely-available BSD-based operating system.

 OpenBSD was built on the existing BSD codebase, with an
 emphasis on security and code correctness. Over the years,
 OpenBSD has implemented a number of security features,
 including the W^X memory protection system, address space
 randomization, and a variety of security-focused daemons. It
 has also added support for modern hardware and introduced
 many new features, such as the packet filter and the OpenSSH
 project.

 Today, OpenBSD is a completely open-source BSD-based
 operating system that is more secure and reliable than Linux,
 but more feature-rich than the original BSD. It is one of the
 most popular BSD distributions, and is used by many
 organizations and individuals for everything from web servers
 to embedded systems.
