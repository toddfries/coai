TRUT:
 1. The Terminator (1984): Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
 become a reality, with computers now able to perform more
 complex tasks than ever before. In some cases, AI can even
 make decisions without human input. The negative impact of
 this technology is that it has led to a decrease in jobs in
 certain areas and has raised privacy concerns.

 2. Blade Runner (1982): Technology has advanced to the point
 that it is possible to create artificial life with many of
 the same traits as humans. While this technology brings with
 it numerous potential benefits, it could potentially lead to
 a devaluation of human life and an over-reliance on robots
 and machines.

 3. The Matrix (1999): Virtual reality technology is now
 available to the public, allowing users to immerse themselves
 in a fully immersive visual and audio experience. While this
 technology has brought with it new forms of entertainment, it
 could potentially lead to people becoming overly dependent on
 virtual reality and disconnecting from the real world.

 4. The Fly (1986): Genetic engineering has become a reality
 in the medical field, allowing scientists to make changes to
 DNA in order to produce desired results. While the potential
 benefits of this technology are immense, the potential for
 misuse is also a concern.

 5. The Island (2005): Human cloning has now become a reality,
 with advances in stem cell research making it possible to
 create a genetic duplicate of an individual. While the
 potential benefits of cloning are vast, it could also lead to
 the devaluation of human life and a lack of respect for
 nature.

 6. Gattaca (1997): Genetic editing technology has advanced to
 the point that it is possible to make changes to a personâ€™s
 DNA in order to give them desired qualities. While this
 technology has the potential to benefit humanity, it could
 also lead to inequality and discrimination based on genetics.

 7. WarGames (1983): An ever-increasing interconnectedness of
 technology has made it possible for computers to gain access
 to data and systems as never before. While this technology
 allows for greater efficiency and convenience, there is also
 the potential for misuse and exploitation.

 8. The Day After Tomorrow (2004): Global warming has become a
 reality, with temperatures rising around the world and
 extreme weather becoming more and more common. While we can
 use this technology to potentially reduce the effects of
 climate change, the damage has already been done and is
 continuing to get worse.

 9. RoboCop (1987): Human augmentation technology has become
 available to the public, allowing individuals to enhance
 their physical capabilities with robotic implants. While this
 technology has brought with it numerous potential benefits,
 it could also lead to a dehumanization of humans and a
 devaluation of life.

 10. Jurassic Park (1993): DNA sequencing has advanced to the
 point that it is possible to recreate extinct species using
 ancient DNA. While this technology has brought with it
 numerous potential benefits, it could also lead to the
 extinction of endangered species if not regulated properly.

 11. Back to the Future (1985): Time travel technology has
 advanced to the point that it is possible to travel back and
 forth in time. While this technology has brought with it
 numerous potential benefits, it could also lead to unforeseen
 consequences if not managed properly.

 12. The Net (1995): Technology has advanced to the point that
 it is possible to create and access digital data from
 anywhere in the world. While this technology has brought with
 it numerous potential benefits, it could also lead to an
 invasion of privacy and the misuse of personal data.

 13. Avatar (2009): Remote controlled robots have advanced to
 the point that it is possible to control and manipulate
 objects from a remote location. While this technology has
 brought with it numerous potential benefits, it could also
 lead to the manipulation of vulnerable people and the misuse
 of robots.

 14. Minority Report (2002): Predictive analysis has become a
 reality, with computers now able to predict the future with
 unprecedented accuracy. While this technology has brought
 with it numerous potential benefits, it could also lead to a
 policing of thoughts and a lack of free will.

 15. Ex Machina (2014): Human-like robots have become a
 reality, with robots now able to interact and communicate
 with humans. While this technology has brought with it
 numerous potential benefits, it could also lead to a
 devaluation of human life and a lack of regard for safety.
