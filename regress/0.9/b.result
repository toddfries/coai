 by our phones and computers and this can lead to an increase
 in anxiety.
 2) Total Recall (1990): In the movie, technology was used to
 implant false memories in humans. Research into memory
 manipulation has been conducted since Total Recall was
 released and there are concerns about ethical implications.
 3) WarGames (1983): In the movie, a computer was able to
 learn and play strategic war games. Since then, computers
 have become significantly more intelligent and are now being
 used for military applications, including autonomous weapon
 systems.
 4) Star Trek (1966): In the movie, futuristic medical
 technology was able to save lives. Since then, medical
 technology, such as MRI scanners and artificial organs, have
 made a huge impact on medical care, but can also lead to
 over-diagnosis and over-treatment.
 5) Blade Runner (1982): In the movie, robots were used to
 perform mundane tasks, much like robots today. However, the
 widespread use of robots has come with a cost, as many people
 are now displaced in the workforce due to automation.
 6) Back To The Future (1985): In this movie, a time machine
 was used to travel back in time. Scientists have been working
 on ways to achieve time travel since this movie was released,
 with some believing it is possible in theory.
 7) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004): In this
 movie, technology was used to erase memories. Since then,
