TRUT: 
 1. AI: Artificial Intelligence (2001): AI has become more
 prominent in our lives and technology, with things like Siri
 and Alexa. However, experts fear that the unchecked
 development of AI could lead to a potential displacement of
 jobs and the potential for unintended consequences.
 2. Cellular Network (The Matrix, 1999): Mobile phones are
 ubiquitous in today's society, allowing us to stay connected
 with people around the globe. However, increased exposure to
 radio frequency radiation has raised health concerns.
 3. Invisibility (Hollow Man, 2000): Developments in
 metamaterials have enabled a form of invisibility cloaking,
 but there have been concerns of potential military
 applications.
 4. Time Travel (Back To The Future, 1985): Recent
 developments in quantum mechanics have allowed for the
 theoretical possibility of time travel, although the
 practical implications of travelling through time remain a
 mystery.
 5. Remote Piloting (Avatar, 2009): Advances in drone
 technology and robotics have enabled us to fly over, and
 sometimes control, devices from afar. This has been employed
 in both the military and commercial spheres, though there has
 been some controversy over privacy concerns.
 6. Cryogenic Freezing (The 6th Day, 2000): Research has been
 conducted on how to suspend human embryos and potentially
 reanimate them in the future, although this is still a
 relatively unexplored concept.
 7. Human-Robot Interaction (I Robot, 2004): Robotics is
 becoming a major field of research in many domains, enabling
 complex communication between humans and robots.
 8. Virtual Reality (The Lawnmower Man, 1992): Virtual reality
 has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling us to
 explore and engage with simulations of different
 environments. However, there have been some concerns
 regarding the potential for physical and mental health issues
 due to prolonged immersion in virtual reality.
 9. Video Conferencing (2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968): Today,
 video conferencing platforms allow us to stay connected with
 people anywhere in the world. Although this technology has
 had a huge positive effect on enabling businesses to connect,
 it has also resulted in increased screen-time, leading to
 physical inactivity and even digital addiction.
 10. Cyber Terrorism (The Net, 1995): Cyber security is
 becoming a major issue as hackers become more sophisticated
 and threaten to disrupt communications and systems in
 companies and countries.
 11. Autonomous Weapons (Terminator, 1984): Autonomous weapons
 systems are being developed by countries around the world,
 which raises concerns over the potential for unchecked wars
 and even the possibility of a global arms race.
 12. Space Colonization (Alien, 1979):Space exploration
 initiatives are now underway to colonize Mars and other
 planets in our Solar System. However, this could have serious
 ecological and economic consequences.
 13. Voice-Cloning (Anon, 2018): Voice-cloning technology has
 advanced significantly in recent times, allowing us to create
 convincing audio simulations of people's voices. This could
 be employed for malicious purposes, such as identity fraud.
 14. Weather Manipulation (The Day After Tomorrow, 2004):
 Scientists have developed technology to manipulate weather
 systems and reduce the impact of natural disasters. However,
 the environmental consequences of such manipulation are
 hardly understood.
 15. Cyber-Surveillance (Minority Report, 2002): We now live
 in a society with almost continuous surveillance through CCTV
 cameras and data collection by tech companies. This has
 raised important debates over privacy rights, surveillance
 capitalism, and other ethical considerations.
