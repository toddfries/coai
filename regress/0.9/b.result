TRUT: 
 1. Automated Nannies - AI-based babysitting apps like Momo
 have been released, which can automate a variety of tasks for
 parents. However, this technology could potentially reduce
 quality interactions between parents and their children.
 (Momo, 2019)
 2. Virtual Reality - Virtual Reality technology has enabled
 people to experience virtual environments. Though it is
 beneficial in many ways, it has caused people to become
 disconnected from their physical environment. (Tron, 1982)
 3. Sentient Machines - Machines with AI capabilities have
 become smarter, and can understand and process human
 language. While these machines are enabling us to automate
 tedious tasks, they also risk creating controlled
 environments, restricted freedom and inequality in society.
 (Blade Runner, 1982)
 4. Autonomous Weapons Systems - Autonomous weapons systems,
 including drones and robotic weapons, have been developed for
 military and law enforcement. Though this technology can help
 limit human casualties in conflicts, it presents a risk of
 unchecked violence, and can potentially be used for
 oppressive goals. (RoboCop, 1987)
 5. Space Colonization - Advances in space exploration have
 made it possible for humans to live in space. Though this
 development can open up new opportunities for humanity, it
 can also create new environmental risks, as well as potential
 competition between nations over resources and land. (2001: A
 Space Odyssey, 1968)
 6. Human Cybernetics - Cybernetics, or the integration of
 machines and human biology, is now a reality. This technology
 can provide enhanced physical abilities and capabilities, but
 it could also create inequality between the few that can
 afford the technology and those that do not. (Robocop, 1987)
 7. Autonomous Cars - Autonomous cars have been developed and
 are now available for public use. These cars can make roads
 safer, but could potentially put people out of jobs, and
 could potentially eliminate the need for certain driving
 skills. (Total Recall, 1990)
 8. Synthetic Organisms - Synthetic organisms, or lifeforms
 created from synthetic material, have been created in
 laboratories. This technology can be used to create new
 medicines and technology, but can also create ethical
 dilemmas, such as what rights these organisms should have if
 any. (Blade Runner, 1982)
 9. Holograms - Holograms are now available, allowing people
 to interact with virtual images and objects. Though this
 technology can create unique visual experiences, it could
 also be used to create and distribute false or misleading
 information. (Star Wars Ep IV, 1977)
 10. Cyborgs - Cybernetics are now available to individuals,
 allowing them to become cyborgs, or a human-machine hybrid.
 Though this could enable people to achieve new levels of
 physical and mental prowess, it could also create new levels
 of inequality and discrimination. (The Terminator, 1984)
 11. Thought/Emotion Control - Technology is now available
 that can read and control human thoughts and emotions. Though
 this technology can be used for medical purposes, it could
 also be used to manipulate individuals and repress certain
 thoughts and emotions. (Total Recall, 1990)
 12. Time Travel - Time travel is now possible through
 technologies such as quantum teleportation and time machines.
 Though this technology can potentially open up new
 opportunities for humanity, it can also lead to the creation
 of parallel timelines and the potential for paradoxes. (Back
 to the Future, 1985)
 13. Robotics - Robotics are now commonplace, and are used in
 a variety of industries and applications. While this
 technology can automate tasks and create jobs, it can also
 lead to the devaluation of human labor, as robots can
 complete tasks faster and more efficiently than humans.
 (Short Circuit, 1986)
 14. Artificial Intelligence - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is
 now a reality, and is used in a variety of applications,
 including financial forecasting and medical diagnosis. Though
 this technology can help humans with their day-to-day tasks,
 it could also be used to create an unequal power dynamic
 between humans and machines. (Blade Runner, 1982)
 15. Digital Surveillance - Advances in technology have
 enabled governments and corporations to monitor citizens
 through digital surveillance. Though this technology can help
 governments and law enforcement with tracking criminals and
 terrorist groups, it can also create a "big brother" scenario
 where privacy is lost and civil liberties are threatened.
 (Enemy of the State, 1998)
