TRUT: 
 1. Jurassic Park (1993): The film's premise of cloning
 dinosaurs has since become reality after the successful
 cloning of the Pyrenean ibex in 2009. This has opened up
 possibilities for other extinct species to be cloned, which
 could have a negative impact on the environment.

 2. Her (2013): Artificial Intelligence has become a reality
 in the form of digital assistants like Siri, Alexa, and
 Google Assistant. These AI assistants have had a negative
 impact on people's privacy by collecting large amounts of
 data and making it available to third parties.

 3. I, Robot (2004): Robots are being used in factories to
 automate production and will likely replace many human jobs
 in the near future. This will result in job displacement and
 economic disruption.

 4. The Matrix (1999): Virtual reality technology has become
 reality and is used in many ways. It has the potential to
 become a form of escapism, leading people to lose touch with
 reality and become addicted to it.

 5. WarGames (1983): Computer hacking is a major concern in
 the 21st century, with cyber attacks becoming more frequent
 and sophisticated. This has a negative effect on businesses,
 governments, and individuals as they attempt to protect
 themselves from malicious actors.

 6. Blade Runner (1982): Genetic engineering has become a
 reality with the advent of CRISPR technology, which can be
 used to modify or delete genes. This technology can have a
 detrimental effect on the environment as it disrupts the
 delicate balance between species.

 7. Terminator (1984): Artificial Intelligence has become a
 reality with products such as programmable, self-driving
 cars, automated weaponry, and intelligent robots. This could
 lead to a world where machines are in control and humans lack
 autonomy.

 8. The Island (2005): Human cloning is now a reality with the
 successful cloning of a sheep in 1996. This technology could
 be used to facilitate unethical practices such as cloning
 organs to sell on the black market.

 9. Minority Report (2002): The use of facial recognition
 technology is becoming increasingly common and is being used
 to monitor people's movements and behaviors, which could lead
 to a loss of privacy.

 10. The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951): Nuclear weapons are
 a reality, with countries such as the United States and
 Russia possessing large arsenals of them. This has a
 potentially devastating outcome if used, leading to immense
 destruction and loss of life.

 11. Gattaca (1997): Genetic engineering has become a reality
 with the ability to modify or delete genes, allowing parents
 to modify their children's physical or mental attributes.
 This could lead to the creation of a dystopia in which some
 people are naturally superior to others.

 12. Total Recall (1990): Brain implants and neural links
 allow the user to control armies of robots or access large
 amounts of data stored in the cloud. This technology, if
 abused, could be used to manipulate the user or invade their
 privacy.

 13. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986): The film predicted
 the invention of the mobile telephone, which has now become
 commonplace. Unfortunately, this has caused distraction and
 nuisance in some cases, leading to a decrease in face-to-face
 interaction.

 14. Inception (2010): Computer simulations are now used in
 certain fields such as engineering, medicine and
 architecture. This creates a risk of people not having a real
 understanding of the physical world, as they rely too heavily
 on realistic simulations.

 15. Wall-E (2008): Automated robots are becoming increasingly
 common and in some cases have replaced human workers. This
 could lead to a future in which robots are the majority and
 humans are no longer necessary.
