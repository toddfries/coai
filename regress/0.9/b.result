 1. Robotic Companions - In the movie "AI: Artificial
 Intelligence" (2001), the robotic boy David was created to be
 a companion for an adult human. Robotic companions are now a
 reality and have been found to have a negative impact on the
 emotional well-being of children, potentially leading to
 emotional detachment from humans.
 2. 3D Printer Technology - In the movie "Terminator 2:
 Judgment Day" (1991), a liquid metal terminator was created
 with the help of a 3D printer. The widespread adoption of 3D
 printer technology has resulted in a range of economic and
 ethical implications, including the ability to create
 counterfeit objects and produce low-quality parts.
 3. Space Exploration - In the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey"
 (1968), humans embarked on a mission to Jupiter. Space
 exploration is now a reality with human missions to the moon,
 Mars, and beyond. Negative impacts include the possibility of
 contamination of alien planets with terrestrial bacteria and
 the risk of space debris to both spacecraft and satellites.
 4. Autonomous Driving - In the movie "Demolition Man" (1993),
 cars are self-driving and regulated by a centralized computer
 system. Autonomous driving is now a reality and has resulted
 in the potential for software hacking, accidents due to
 misplaced trust in the technology, and the potential for
 privacy violations.
 5. Humanoid Robots - In the movie "Blade Runner" (1982),
 androids have been developed that look and act just like
 humans. Humanoid robots are now a reality and have raised
 ethical questions about the treatment of robots and their
 potential as a replacement for human labor.

 augmented reality is used to interact with objects and data.
 Augmented reality is now a reality and has been found to
 cause addiction and distraction with long-term effects yet to
 be determined.
 7. Teleportation - In the movie "Star Trek" (1966),
 teleportation devices were used to instantaneously transport
 humans across long distances. Teleportation technology is now
 a reality, although it only works with very small particles
 or single atoms, and has raised concerns about the potential
 loss or misplacement of information.
 8. Genetic Engineering - In the movie "Jurassic Park" (1993),
 dinosaurs were recreated using genetic engineering. Genetic
 engineering is now a reality and has resulted in debates over
 the safety, morality, and potential misuse of genetic
 engineering technology.
 9. Artificial Intelligence - In the movie "The Terminator"
 (1984), artificial intelligence develops an evil
 consciousness and seeks to destroy all humans. Artificial
 intelligence is now a reality and has raised concerns about
 the potential for AI to become too powerful and potentially
 be used for unethical purposes.
 10. Nanotechnology - In the movie "Fantastic Voyage" (1966),
 a team is shrunk down to microscopic size and travel inside a
 human body. Nanotechnology is now a reality, and although it
 has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of medicine,
 there is a potential for its misuse.
 11. Brain-Computer Interfaces - In the movie "The Matrix"
 (1999), humans are plugged into a virtual reality world.
 Brain-computer interfaces are now a reality, and although
 they offer a range of incredible possibilities, they also
 open the door to potential privacy and security issues.
 12. Virtual Reality - In the movie "The Lawnmower Man"
 (1992), virtual reality technology is used to enhance the
 intelligence of a person. Virtual reality is now a reality
 and has raised questions about how it should be regulated and
 how it might affect our ability to distinguish between
 reality and fantasy.
 13. Drone Technology - In the movie "Enemy of the State"

 now a reality and has caused safety and privacy concerns, as
 well as ethical debates around the potential use of drones
 for targeted assassination.
 14. Time Travel - In the movie "Back to the Future" (1985),
 time travel was used to go back in time and change history.
 Time travel is now a reality, although only in the form of
 time dilation, and raises philosophical questions about the
 consequences of time travel and its potential misuse.
 15. Jetpacks - In the movie "The Rocketeer" (1991), a jetpack
 is used to fly around. Jetpacks are now a reality, although
 they are not as advanced as those in the movie, and have
