 1. Biological and ecological disasters: The movie “The Day
 After Tomorrow” (2004) portrayed the sudden deterioration of
 the planet’s environment due to climate change. This has
 become a reality with increasing reports of extreme weather
 occurrences and rising sea levels due to global warming.

 2. Physical and mental augmentation: The movie “Elysium”
 (2013) showed a world where technology has taken away the
 differences between the wealthy and the poor. This has become
 an issue in recent years with companies and governments using
 technology to further their own interests and the
 exploitation of people from different social levels.

 3. Gender discrimination: The movie “Her” (2013) showed us a
 world where technology has taken away the differences between
 the sexes. Again, this has become true in the real world with
 modern technologies, leading to discrimination and gender
 inequality.

 focused on the development of artificial intelligence with
 dangerous consequences. This, too, has become reality with AI
 development and its application in various areas, such as
 finance and warfare.

 5. Technology-induced violence: The movie “Robocop” (1987)
 depicted a world where police forces used robots and androids
 to enforce law and order through violence. This has become an
 issue in the real world, with the use of drones and
 autonomous weapons to conduct warfare without human
 oversight.

 6. Weaponized super humans: The movie “X-Men 2” (2003) showed
 powerful mutants being used as living weapons. This has
 become a reality with the military using soldiers with
 enhanced abilities, such as those in the IDF's Unit 8200 and
 the United States’s secretive program DARPA.

 7. Nuclear warfare: The movie “Dr. Strangelove or: How I
 Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb” (1964) showed a
 world where nuclear warfare can occur at any moment. This has
 become true in the real world, with the proliferation of
 nuclear weapons and the possibility of a nuclear war.

 8. Human-animal hybrids: The movie “Splice” (2009) showed
 humans combining the DNA of different species in order to
 create hybrid creatures. This has become a reality with the
 use of cloning and genetic engineering to create human-animal
 hybrids.

 9. Social media addiction: The movie “The Circle” (2017)
 showed a world where social media and technology have
 replaced personal interaction and consumed people’s lives.
 This has become a reality, with people increasingly turning
 to social media for companionship and entertainment, ignoring
 its potential for addiction.

 10. Technological surveillance: The movie “Minority Report”
 (2002) showed a world where technology is used to constantly
 monitor people’s movements and activities. This has become
 true in recent years, with governments and corporations
 deploying surveillance technologies across the world.

 11. Virtual Reality: The movie “The Matrix” (1999) showed a
 world where people’s minds are put into virtual reality and
 disconnected from the real world. This has become a reality,
 with virtual reality technology becoming more and more
 accessible.

 12. Blackmail: The movie “The Social Network” (2010)
 presented a world where people’s private information is used
 against them. This has become reality, with the use of
 personal information for blackmail and extortion.

 13. Autonomous vehicles: The movie “I, Robot” (2004) showed a
 world where robots are used to replace human labor. This has
 become true in the real world, with driverless cars being
 developed and becoming more and more common.

 14. robot servants: The movie “Blade Runner” (1982) portrayed
 robots as servants and tools of humans. This has become a
 reality, with robots being used for a variety of tasks, such
 as in factories and hospitals.

 15. Exploitation of natural resources: The movie “Wall-E”
 (2008) showed a world where humans have depleted and
 contaminated the planet’s natural resources. This has become
 a reality, with businesses exploiting resources and polluting
 the environment for their own financial gain.
