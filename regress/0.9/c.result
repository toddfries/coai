TRUT: 
 1. Cybernetics - Cybernatics (2019) - This movie portrays the
 idea of human enhancement through the use of cybernetic
 technology, which could potentially allow humans to become
 more efficient, better adapted to their environment, and
 increase their physical and mental abilities beyond their
 current potential.
 2. Autonomous Cars - Blade Runner 2049 (2017) - Autonomous
 cars will have a drastic effect on transportation, making it
 safer and more efficient. They would be able to avoid traffic
 jams and accidents, as well as generate less emissions.
 3. Artificial Intelligence - A.I. Artificial Intelligence
 (2001) - The development of artificial intelligence will
 allow machines to think, learn, and develop in ways that
 weren't possible before. This could result in massive
 economic growth, increased safety, and improved healthcare.
 4. Space Exploration - Gravity (2013) - Advances in space
 exploration will allow us to explore more unknown parts of
 the universe and bring us closer to understanding our place
 in the universe.
 5. Renewable Energy - A Quiet Place (2018) - Renewable energy
 sources, such as solar and wind, will replace the dirty and
 dangerous forms of energy currently in use, making our
 environment cleaner and healthier.
 6. Robotics - WALL-E (2008) - Robotics will enable us to
 create machines that can perform tedious and dangerous tasks,
 saving us time and making us more efficient.
 7. Augmented Reality - Ready Player One (2018) - Augmented
 reality can enhance our daily lives by providing us with
 real-time information and enhancing our understanding of the
 world around us.
 8. Molecular Nanotechnology - The Matrix (1999) - Molecular
 nanotechnology will allow us to manipulate matter on very
 small scales, allowing us to create efficient energy sources,
 materials, and various other technologies.
 9. 3D Printing - The Lego Movie (2014) - 3D printing will
 revolutionize the way we make products, allowing us to make
 complex items quickly and cheaply, as well as customize
 products that have never been possible before.
