TRUT: 
 1. Virtual Reality (The Matrix, 1999): Virtual reality will
 allow individuals to visit places, experience events, and
 encounter characters that do not exist in the physical world.
 This will increase the range of experiences people can have,
 and make the world a more interesting place to live.

 2. Autonomous Robotic Systems (I, Robot, 2004): Autonomous
 robotic systems will increase efficiency and reduce human
 labor in areas such as manufacturing and farming. This will
 free up human capital to be used in more creative endeavors,
 and reduce the cost of everyday goods.

 3. Cybernetic Prosthetics (RoboCop, 1987): Cybernetic
 prosthetics will allow people to replace lost limbs, regain
 lost hearing and seeing, and extend the capabilities of
 physical bodies. This will increase the quality of life for
 people with disabilities, and give them new opportunities
 that may have otherwise been unavailable to them.

 4. Artificial Intelligence (Blade Runner, 1982): Artificial
 intelligence will allow machines to think and act in ways
 that no human is capable of. This will provide a wide range
 of benefits, including increased efficiency, improved safety,
 and better decision making processes.

 5. Human Augmentation (Elysium, 2013): Human augmentation
 will use technology to enhance human physical and mental
 capabilities. This will give people the ability to access
 skills and abilities that would otherwise be out of reach,
 and increase their potential for success in the modern world.

 6. Force Field Technology (Star Wars, 1977): Force field
 technology will create barriers that can protect against
 physical and energy-based attacks. This will greatly improve
 safety and security, and reduce the need for military
 conflict.

 7. 3D Printing (Iron Sky, 2012): 3D printing will allow
 people to create objects simply by using a computer. This
 will reduce the cost and effort of producing items, and could
 be used to revolutionize manufacturing.

 8. Space Exploration (Gravity, 2013): Space exploration will
 allow humanity to reach other worlds and discover new and
 exciting things. This will potentially open up new sources of
 energy, resources, and knowledge which can be used to benefit
 mankind.

 9. Holograms (Star Trek, 1966): Holograms will allow people
 to experience the world in a different way. This could be
 used to enhance communication, or to provide virtual
 entertainment and educational experiences.

 10. Autonomous Vehicles (Minority Report, 2002): Autonomous
 vehicles will reduce the need for human drivers, allowing
 people to travel more efficiently and safely. This will
 improve the lives of those living in cities, reduce traffic
 fatalities, and reduce pollution.

 11. Teleportation (The Fly, 1986): Teleportation will allow
 people to move instantly between locations. This will reduce
 the need for traditional transportation methods, and reduce
 the time it takes to travel over long distances.

 12. Genetic Engineering (Gattaca, 1997): Genetic engineering
 will allow people to improve their physical and mental
 capabilities. This will reduce the prevalence of genetic
 diseases, and could extend the human lifespan.

 13. Cloning (The Island, 2005): Cloning will allow people to
 replicate themselves, or the genetic material of others. This
 could provide a way to extend life, or create copies of
 people with improved traits or abilities.

 14. Smart Home Technology (Smart House, 1999): Smart home
 technology will allow people to control their environment
 with a simple voice command. This will reduce energy costs,
 increase convenience, and improve the quality of life for
 millions of people.

 15. Nanotechnology (Fantastic Voyage, 1966): Nanotechnology
 will allow people to interact with objects on a microscopic
 level. This could be used to manipulate matter in ways that
 were previously impossible, and revolutionize medicine,
 energy production, and many other fields.
