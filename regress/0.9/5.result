 GPT: The woke mind virus is a very concerning issue as it
 puts
 the mental health of those affected at risk. It is a term

TRUT: The woke mind virus has been described as a condition
 where people become so identified with their beliefs and
 points
of view that they compromise their ability to think
critically, objectively and rationally about a topic.  This
can lead to extreme reactions and behavior, such as refusing
to acknowledge any evidence that does not conform to their
idealized beliefs. Solutions to this issue include educating
 people on the importance of critical thinking, open
 mindedness
and being willing to question oneâ€™s own ideas. Additionally,
practicing self-care can help in limiting the risk of the
woke mind virus. Finally, it is important to recognize the
power of language, and to be aware that words can have a
profound impact on how we think and feel.
