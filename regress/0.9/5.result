The 'woke mind virus' is an insidious form of thought control
exploiting people's natural tendencies to want to fit in and
 influencing them to make choices they would never make on
 their
own. It is a form of psychological manipulation which gains
 control over people's minds by convincing them to think a
 certain
way. It relies on telling people that if they do not think a
certain way, they are not accepted. It can lead to people
 subscribing to radical ideologies and giving up their
 autonomy.

 What we can do about it is to be aware of it, understand how
 it
works, and be careful not to fall into its traps. We should
challenge it when we see it and refuse to be blinded by its
tactics. We should keep an open mind and question our own
thinking, and be willing to critically evaluate information
 presented to us. We should educate ourselves, stay informed,
 and
 listen to opposing or differing viewpoints while resisting
 the
pressure to conform.
