 GPT: The 'woke mind virus' is a problem because it is leading
 people to think and act in ways that are not supported by
 facts and evidence. It is also causing people to be
 increasingly polarized and hostile to each other.

 TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a problem because of the way
 it leads people to think they are more knowledgeable and wise
 than they actually are. It is a problem because it causes
 people to believe untruths or opinions that are unverified,
 and it discourages the use of independent thinking and
 rational inquiry. To address the 'woke mind virus', people
 should focus on learning to think critically, verifying the
 sources of their information, and looking for evidence that
 contradicts their beliefs.
