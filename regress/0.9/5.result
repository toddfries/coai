 GPT: The 'woke mind virus' is a problem because it is a form
 of
 thought policing that silences dissenting opinions and
 stifles
 creativity in conversations. It can be seen as a form of
 censorship where people are shamed for their beliefs and
 opinions.

TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a pervasive set of thought
 patterns and beliefs which attempt to control the thoughts,
words, and actions of individuals. It enforces a rigid
ideology and social hierarchy which is highly damaging to the
diversity of thought and opinion across society. In order to
combat this virus we need to practice open dialogue and
discourage the silencing of dissenting opinions. We also need
to encourage critical thinking and question the established
norms.
