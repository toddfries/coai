 GPT: The 'woke mind virus' is a problem because it leads
 people to take extreme positions on issues related to social
 justice, identity politics, or any other controversial topic.
 People can become so entrenched in their own viewpoints that
 it is hard for them to see any other perspective.

 TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a phenomenon that takes many
 different forms, but generally refers to the tendency of some
 people to polarise their stance on societal issues rather
 than making an effort to consider opposing viewpoints. This
 behaviour can have damaging consequences in terms of
 deepening political divides and creating socio-cultural
 tension. To combat this, it is important to engage in active
 discourse and ensure that all sides are heard and that mutual
 respect is shown in discussions. Additionally, amplifying the
 voices of historically marginalised groups is vital in order
 to create a more equitable society.
