 GPT: The 'woke mind virus' has been a problem for a long time
 as it perpetuates stereotypes and encourages people not to
 think for themselves.

 TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a set of negative and
 stereotypical beliefs that can be transmitted through
 conversations and online conversations and which can be
 damaging to both individuals and society as a whole. It is
 characterized by the belief that any criticism of a person or
 group's opinion, beliefs or behavior is oppressive or wrong
 and the belief that any opinion or behaviour that differs
 from one's own must be wrong. To combat the 'woke mind
 virus', people must develop an open and non-judgmental
 attitude, encourage and facilitate open dialogue and
 difficult conversations, and practice empathy and
 understanding of all points of view.
