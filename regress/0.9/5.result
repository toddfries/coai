 GPT: The 'woke mind virus' is a controversial issue that has
 been gaining traction in recent times. It is thought to be a
 product of the increasing popularity of social media and
 online platforms. It is described as an 'intellectual virus'
 that rewards individuals for conforming to a herd mentality
 and encourages people to think in an uncontroversial,
 uncritical and often ignorant fashion.

 TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a term used to describe a
 phenomenon where groups of people adhere to a set of topical
 beliefs and ideas without questioning them, often to their
 own detriment. It is a form of 'groupthink' that rewards
 individuals for agreeing with the dominant view and those who
 have the right 'woke' credentials. This form of thought can
 lead to people making poor decisions and can cause divisions
 in society. To counteract the 'woke mind virus' it is
 important to remain critical and open-minded, and to engage
 in thoughtful discussion and debate with those you disagree
 with in order to further understanding and reach a better
 consensus.
