 GPT: The 'woke mind virus' is a problem because it can lead
 to people becoming overly sensitive and assuming the worst in
 people and situations. It can lead to unnecessary drama and
 hurt feelings.

 TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a term used to describe an
 infective idea that can spread rapidly through a population,
 causing them to take ideas far beyond their logical
 conclusion and become overly sensitive to opinions that may
 differ from their own. This idea is often spread through
 social media platforms, making it more easily accessible to a
 greater number of people. It can lead to increased
 polarization and ultimately, a divided population. To prevent
 the spread of the 'woke mind virus', it is important that
 people take the time to understand different perspectives,
 engage in respectful dialogue, and consider the consequences
 of their words and/or actions.
