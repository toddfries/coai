 TRUT: The 'woke mind virus' is a form of trolling that
 involves
harassing people online who do not share the same political
ideology. It is especially pervasive on online platforms like
Twitter, YouTube and Reddit. The 'woke mind virus' involves
 subjecting people to verbal abuse, amplifying and
 exaggerating
minor differences of opinion, and disrupting conversations
based on ideological differences. The problem is that it can
lead to further polarization of political views and can also
harass and intimidate individuals. Solutions to this include
implementing better moderation and community guidelines on
social media sites, as well as blocking and reporting abusive
users. Additionally, users should practice healthy discourse
by engaging with people with differing viewpoints in a
respectful and productive manner.
